While in principle any set of images can be in a\\nmanifest list, the intended use is housing multi-platform and/or multi-arch\\nimages. Otherwise, manifest lists mostly look and feel like regular container\\nimages. You can pull, tag, and run them as you\'d expect, with only a few\\nexceptions.\\n\\nTwo and a half things will likely catch you off-guard:\\n\\n- Pushing manifest lists to registries\\n- Removing manifest lists from local storage.\\n- The `podman tag` command is broken for manifest lists in `v3.4`, but\\n  works in Buildah `v1.23.1`.\\n\\nDue to the way image-name references are internally processed, you should\\n**not** use the usual `podman push` and `podman rmi` subcommands.\\n**THEY WILL NOT DO WHAT YOU EXPECT!** Instead, you\'ll want to use\\n[`podman manifest push --all <src> <dest>`](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-manifest-push.1.html) and\\n[`podman manifest rm <name>`](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-manifest-rm.1.html)\\n(similarly for `buildah`). These will push/remove the manifest list\\nitself instead of the contents. Similarly for tagging if you\'re on Podman `v3.4`,\\nuse the `buildah tag` command instead.\\n\\nGreat, so manifest lists sound awesome; I can pull, and run them.\\nI can delete them with `podman manifest rm`, push with\\n`podman manifest push --all <src> <dest>`, and `tag` with Buildah,\\nbut how can I create them?\\n\\n## Easy Mode\\n\\nThe simplest way to create a multi-arch manifest list is by enabling\\nemulation to support any non-native `RUN` instructions. This is done\\nby installing the `qemu-user-static` package (or equivalent) for your\\ndistribution. Also ensure the related `systemd-binfmt.service` is\\nenabled/started. Not all distributions support these, so skip to the\\nnext sections for details on other methods if required.\\n\\nAssuming emulation is in place, let\u2019s look at this example _Containerfile_:\\n\\n```Dockerfile\\nFROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8:latest\\nRUN uname -a\\n```\\n\\nBuilding a multi-arch manifest for this can be done with one build command.\\nThis is thanks to features of recent versions of Buildah (`v1.23` and later)\\nand Podman (`v3.4` and later):\\n\\n```bash\\n$ platarch=linux/amd64,linux/ppc64le,linux/arm64,linux/s390x\\n$ buildah build --jobs=4 --platform=$platarch --manifest shazam .\\n```\\n\\nThe key options used here are:\\n\\n- `--manifest` - Add the resulting image into the named manifest list (`shazam`),\\n  creating it if it doesn\'t already exist.\\n- `--platform` - Accepts a comma-separated list of `platform/architecture`\\n  tuples (`linux/amd64,linux/ppc64le,linux/arm64,linux/s390x`).\\n- `--jobs` - Optional, causes the builds to execute in parallel using\\n  the specified number of threads (`4`). i.e., the build finishes much\\n  faster.\\n\\n_Note_: Even this simple `Containerfile` and build command will produce\\nquite a lot of output. Assuming it\'s successful, you may use the following\\ncommand to examine the architectures:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ skopeo inspect --raw containers-storage:localhost/shazam | \\\\\\n      jq \'.manifests[].platform.architecture\'\\n```\\n\\nSimilarly,\\n[`skopeo inspect`](https://github.com/containers/skopeo/blob/main/docs/skopeo-inspect.1.md)\\ncan be used to examine manifest lists on registry servers - just swap\\n`containers-storage:` with `docker://`. This is very useful for\\ndetermining if a base image is a manifest list, and if it is, which\\narchitecture the images were built for. Querying metadata in this\\nway doesn\'t require pulling down all the data, so it\'s quite fast.\\n\\nLastly and as mentioned at the beginning, pushing and removing manifest\\nlists is special. You **must** use `manifest push` or `manifest rm` sub-commands.\\nOtherwise, Podman will act on the contents rather than the manifest list\\nitself. Then for push, you must specify both the source and destination.\\nA somewhat contrived example might be:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ buildah tag localhost/shazam quay.io/example/shazam\\n$ podman manifest rm localhost/shazam\\n$ podman manifest push --all quay.io/example/shazam docker://quay.io/example/shazam\\n```\\n\\nIf you don\'t specify both the source and push destination, you\'ll\\nget an error message. In case you\'re wondering, the `--all` argument is\\nrequired. This tells Podman to push the manifest list AND the contents,\\nwhich is nearly always what you want to do. If you don\u2019t use the `--all`\\noption, only the native architecture will be sent without any warning or\\nother indications.\\n\\n## Cheat Mode\\n\\nIn the case of public automation services, where convenience and ease of\\nmaintenance are essential, [there are a set of container images that will\\nenable and configure `qermu-user-static` for\\nyou](https://github.com/orgs/multiarch/repositories).\\nThese images must be run in `--privileged` mode but will make\\n[setting things up in the automation system very easy (docs)](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static#getting-started).\\nOnce set up, the image-build method is precisely the same as the above section.\\n\\nThat said, this is not an endorsement, and you will need to perform your own due\\ndiligence. I only mention it in this article because if I don\'t, somebody is\\nbound to bring it up. It\'s likely a fine setup for small, non-critical cases.\\nBut this will probably be a \\"no-go\\", where provenance and security are critical.\\nSo, if that applies to you, continue on to the next section.\\n\\n## Safe Mode\\n\\nIn highly secure, locked-down, production environments using commercially\\nsupported distributions, additional safety is often paramount over the\\nconvenience of emulation. Additionally if the build is simply too complex,\\nemulation-slow, or involves multiple incompatible platforms (i.e., Windows\\nand Darwin) then it simply may not be practical.\\n\\nIn these cases, essentially you need to perform the builds separately,\\ncollect the images on one system, then combine them all into a manifest\\nlist as a separate step.\\n\\nFor example, let\'s assume that you\'ve built the `shazam` image on several\\nlinux hosts, tagged each of them with their architecture name, and pushed them\\nup to the `quay.io/example/shazam` repository. Combining them into a\\nmanifest list might look like this:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ REPO=quay.io/example/shazam\\n$ podman manifest create $REPO:latest\\n$ for IMGTAG in amd64 s390x ppc64le arm64; do \\\\\\n          podman manifest add $REPO:latest docker://$REPO:IMGTAG; \\\\\\n      done\\n$ podman manifest push --all $REPO:latest docker://$REPO:latest\\n```\\n\\n_Note:_ For the\\n[`manifest add`](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-manifest-add.1.html)\\nsub-command, the **target manifest list name comes first, then the image to add**.\\nIn the above example, the command inside the loop will pull down the\\nplatform-tagged image (metadata) and add it into the new manifest list. There\\nis no need for a separate\\n[pull](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-pull.1.html)\\noperation, and Podman will automatically figure out the constituent architecture\\nand platform information. If not, there are\\n[options to specify them manually](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-manifest-add.1.html#arch)\\nduring the `manifest add` operation. Lastly, in case of an accident, you\'ll\\nfind a\\n[`manifest remove`](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-manifest-remove.1.html)\\nsub-command (**same argument-order as `manifest add`**).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhile countless additional details are available in the man pages, this basic\\nknowledge should cover `90%` of your needs.

We\u2019ve been brainstorming, discussing, and testing solutions to bring a great Podman experience to Mac and Windows. We are constantly looking for ways to improve it. In particular, the latest release of Podman has support for ~~Intel~~(as of Podman v3.4) Macs. We have been hearing good feedback for a few weeks now, but up until this point, we haven\u2019t published a lot of documentation.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nRecently, we have been getting an influx of questions about Podman and Podman desktop, specifically around Macs. Coincidentally, we have a really elegant solution which we\u2019d like to introduce. In the recently released Podman-3.3.1, we now have support for Intel-based Macs. It is command-line driven and can be installed through brew (aka [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)).\\n\\n### User Experience on macOS\\n\\nThe user-experience is quite simple:\\n\\n1. Install brew (as it is described on their [homepage](https://brew.sh/))\\n2. Install podman from brew: `brew install podman`\\n3. Initialize a podman machine: `podman machine init`\\n4. Start the machine: `podman machine start`\\n5. Use podman as you normally would.\\n\\nIt is worth running `podman machine --help` to familiarize yourself with the other commands used to manage machines.\\n\\nPlease note that Podman machine is still under development. While we support port forwarding on Macs and Linux, we have not implemented a solution for file sharing and bind mounts. We are currently researching the various technologies to do so as we want to choose a performant approach.\\n\\n~~Podman machine is currently only supported on Linux and Intel Macs. As for the new Macs that are based on Apple Silicon, we are now waiting for two things. First, we need some patches from upstream qemu to get merged and released. While we wait for the upstream patches, we are working on a possible work-around for qemu. If that is successful, we will re-enable the M1 support in Podman and get brew updated. The second is we need [Fedora CoreOS](https://getfedora.org/en/coreos) aarch64 images to be indexed, which should be occurring very shortly.~~ Podman 3.4, Oct-10-2021\\n\\n### User Experience on Windows\\n\\nWe currently support the Windows platform with a remote client that can be downloaded from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases). That remote client requires a Linux server with Podman and its service running. We also have user reports that running Podman in WSL is quite tenable. Consider the WSL option if you do not have available Linux servers with Podman installed.\\n\\nWe intend to develop a desktop for the Mac and Windows experience for Podman. Early design work is under consideration. No timeline has been identified yet.\\n\\n### Questions?\\n\\nRemember, our development team can be found in our [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#podman:matrix.org) which has been bridged to the #podman channel on [libera IRC](https://libera.chat/) as well as our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/x5GzFF6QH4). You can also get in touch with us via our [project page](https://github.com/containers/podman) by opening issues, PR\u2019s and discussions. We love to hear from people!\\n\\nPodman is an open-source project. We are always looking for contributors to help us accelerate features into the Podman and container world."},{"id":"/2021/09/03/new","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2021/09/03/new","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-03-new.md","title":"Podman Posts of Interest","description":"I\'ve been lagging a bit in getting posts up on this site that have landed elsewhere, so time for","date":"2021-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 3, 2021","tags":[{"label":"containers","permalink":"/blogs/tags/containers"},{"label":"podman","permalink":"/blogs/tags/podman"},{"label":"networking","permalink":"/blogs/tags/networking"},{"label":"pod","permalink":"/blogs/tags/pod"},{"label":"api","permalink":"/blogs/tags/api"},{"label":"kubernetes","permalink":"/blogs/tags/kubernetes"},{"label":"kube","permalink":"/blogs/tags/kube"},{"label":"v2","permalink":"/blogs/tags/v-2"},{"label":"hpc","permalink":"/blogs/tags/hpc"},{"label":"windows","permalink":"/blogs/tags/windows"},{"label":"mac","permalink":"/blogs/tags/mac"}],"readingTime":0.17,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"tsweeney"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman Posts of Interest","layout":"default","author":"tsweeney","categories":["new"],"tags":["containers","podman","networking","pod","api","kubernetes","kube","v2","hpc","windows","mac"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Podman remote clients for macOS and Windows","permalink":"/blogs/2021/09/06/podman-on-macs"},"nextItem":{"title":"Podman Posts of Interest","permalink":"/blogs/2021/09/03/podman-posts-of-interests"}},"content":"I\'ve been lagging a bit in getting posts up on this site that have landed elsewhere, so time for\\nanother \\"Podman Posts of Interest\\" post.\\nCheckout the [Podman Posts of Interest](https://podman.io/blogs/2021/09/03/podman-posts-of-interests.html) for the links!"},{"id":"/2021/09/03/podman-posts-of-interests","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2021/09/03/podman-posts-of-interests","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-03-podman-posts-of-interests.md","title":"Podman Posts of Interest","description":"podman logo","date":"2021-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 3, 2021","tags":[{"label":"containers","permalink":"/blogs/tags/containers"},{"label":"podman","permalink":"/blogs/tags/podman"},{"label":"networking","permalink":"/blogs/tags/networking"},{"label":"pod","permalink":"/blogs/tags/pod"},{"label":"api","permalink":"/blogs/tags/api"},{"label":"kubernetes","permalink":"/blogs/tags/kubernetes"},{"label":"kube","permalink":"/blogs/tags/kube"},{"label":"v2","permalink":"/blogs/tags/v-2"},{"label":"hpc","permalink":"/blogs/tags/hpc"},{"label":"windows","permalink":"/blogs/tags/windows"},{"label":"mac","permalink":"/blogs/tags/mac"}],"readingTime":0.81,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"tsweeney"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman Posts of Interest","layout":"default","author":"tsweeney","categories":["blogs"],"tags":["containers","podman","networking","pod","api","kubernetes","kube","v2","hpc","windows","mac"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Podman Posts of Interest","permalink":"/blogs/2021/09/03/new"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to use Podman inside of a container","permalink":"/blogs/2021/07/02/new"}},"content":"![podman logo](../static/vectors/raw/podman.svg)\\n\\n# Podman Posts of Interest\\n\\n## By Tom Sweeney [GitHub](https://github.com/TomSweeneyRedhat)\\n\\nA number of blog posts have flung by and I have not had a chance to get individual\\nlink posts to them, so thought I would add a few here that have popped up recently,\\nlinks after the break!.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n- [Tony Kay](https://github.com/tonykay) - [Running Podman Machine on the Mac M1](https://www.cloudassembler.com/post/podman-machine-mac-m1/) - Tony walks you through all the steps that you\'ll need in order to run Podman on a M1 Mac.\\n- [Abhijeet Kasurde](https://medium.com/@AbhijeetKasurde) - [Running Podman machine on macOS](https://medium.com/@AbhijeetKasurde/running-podman-machine-on-macos-1f3fb0dbf73d) - Abhijeet also walks you through the steps of setting up qemu and Podman machine to run Podman on your Mac.\\n- [Sumantro Mukherjee](https://twitter.com/Bytesofbinary) - [Run a Linux virtual machine in Podman](https://opensource.com/article/21/7/linux-podman) - Sumantro shows you how to use Podman machine to run Fedora CoreOS.\\n- https://github.com/bowmanjd - [Install Docker on Windows (WSL) without Docker Desktop](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/install-docker-on-windows-wsl-without-docker-desktop-34m9) Jonathan shows you how to run Docker or Podman on Windows without Docker Desktop."},{"id":"/2021/07/02/new","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2021/07/02/new","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-02-new.md","title":"How to use Podman inside of a container","description":"Do you want to know how to use Podman inside of a container?

A list of all the available services can be found on: [services.go](https://github.com/fhsinchy/tent/blob/master/store/services.go)\\n\\nTent is heavily inspired from [tighten/takeout](https://github.com/tighten/takeout) and is an experimental project. Hence, care should be taken if you\'re using it in a critical environment.\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\n- Linux\\n- [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) Installed\\n- Podman System Service Running\\n\\nIf you have Podman installed, you can start the system service as follows:\\n\\n```bash\\n## starts the podman system service\\nsystemctl --user start podman.socket\\n\\n## enables the podman system service, so it doesn\'t close on every reboot\\nsystemctl --user enable podman.socket\\n\\n## stops the podman system service\\nsystemctl --user stop podman.socket\\n\\n## disables the podman system service, so it doesn\'t start on every reboot\\nsystemctl --user disable podman.socket\\n```\\n\\nTent assumes that you\'re running the service in non-root mode, hence the `--user` argument is necessary in the above commands.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nVisit the [tent release page](https://github.com/fhsinchy/tent/releases/) and download the `tent` binary to your computer. Open up your terminal where you\'ve donwloaded the file and execute following commands:\\n\\n```bash\\nchmod +x ./tent\\n\\nsudo mv ./tent /usr/local/bin\\n```\\n\\nNow the `tent` command should be available everywhere in your system.\\n\\n## Build From Source\\n\\nIf you\'re on a Fedora system, the following command should install the necessary development dependencies.\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo dnf groupinstall \\"Development Tools\\" -y && sudo dnf install golang btrfs-progs-devel gpgme-devel device-mapper-devel -y\\n```\\n\\nAnd on a Ubuntu system, the following command should install the necessary development dependencies.\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo apt install build-essential golang-go libbtrfs-dev libgpgme-dev libdevmapper-dev -y\\n```\\n\\nIf you\'re on a different system you, may look for equivalent package on the respective package repositories.\\n\\nNow build and install the application as follows:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/fhsinchy/tent.git ~/tent\\n\\ncd ~/tent\\n\\nmake install\\n```\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nThe `tent` binary has following commands:\\n\\n- `tent start <service name>` - starts a container for the given service\\n- `tent stop <service name>` - stops and removes a container for the given service\\n- `tent list` - lists all running containers\\n\\nMost of the services in `tent` utilizes volumes for persisting data, so even if you stop a service, it\'s data will be persisted in a volume for later usage. These volumes can listed by executing `podman volume ls` and can be managed like any other podman volume.\\n\\n### Start a Service\\n\\nThe generic syntax for the `start` command is as follows:\\n\\n```bash\\ntent start <service name>\\n\\n## starts mysql and prompts you where necessary\\ntent start mysql\\n\\n## starts redis and mongo and prompts you where necessary\\ntent start redis mongo\\n```\\n\\n### Start Service with Default Configuration\\n\\nThe `--default` flag for the `start` command can be used to skip all the prompts and start a service with default configuration\\n\\n```bash\\ntent start <service name> --default\\n\\n## starts mysql with the default configuration\\ntent start mysql --default\\n\\n## starts redis and mongo with default configuration\\ntent start redis mongo --default\\n```\\n\\n### Stop a Service\\n\\nThe generic syntax for the `stop` command is as follows:\\n\\n```bash\\ntent stop <service name>\\n\\n## stops mysql and removes the container\\n## prompts you if multiple containers are found\\ntent stop mysql\\n\\n## stops all mysql containers and removes them\\ntent stop mysql --all\\n\\n## stops redis and mongo then removes the containers.\\n## prompts you if multiple containers are found for any of the given services.\\ntent stop redis mongo\\n\\n## stops all redis and mongo conainers and then removes them\\ntent stop redis mongo --all\\n```\\n\\n### Stop all Services\\n\\nThe `--all` flag for the `stop` command can be used to stop and remove all running tent containers at once\\n\\n```bash\\ntent stop --all\\n```\\n\\n## Running Multiple Versions\\n\\nGiven all the services are running inside containers, you can spin up multiple versions of the same service as long as you\'re keeping the port different.\\n\\nRun `tent start mysql` twice; the first time, use the `--default` flag, and the second time, put `5.7` as tag and `3307` as host port.\\n\\nNow, if you run `tent list`, you\'ll see both services running at the same time.\\n\\n```bash\\n+--------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+\\n| CONTAINER              | Image               | PORTS          |\\n+--------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+\\n| tent-mysql-5.7-3307    | docker.io/mysql:5.7 | 3307->3306/tcp |\\n| tent-mysql-latest-3306 | docker.io/mysql:5.7 | 3306->3306/tcp |\\n+--------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+\\n```\\n\\n## Container Management\\n\\nContainers started by `tent` are regular containers with some pre-set configurations. So you can use regular `podman` commands such as `ls`, `inspect`, `logs` etc on them. Although `tent` comes with a `list` command, using the `podman` commands will result in more informative results. The target of `tent` is to provide plug and play containers, not to become a full-fledged `podman` cli.\\n\\n## Contribution\\n\\nTent is an open-source project and contributions are more than welcomed. If you\'re a Go programmer do take some time to go through the source-code, see if you can improve any part of the program, the maintainer will be more than happy to co-operate. And if you like the project, don\'t forget to leave a star and share with other fellow developers to show your appreciation."},{"id":"/2021/02/08/new","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2021/02/08/new","source":"@site/blog/2021-02-08-new.md","title":"Easy Development Dependency Management With Podman and Tent","description":"Tent is an open-source CLI tool for running development dependencies such as MySQL, Mongo, ElasticSearch etc inside pre-configured containers using simple one-liners.

As noted in that document, the Podman API v1.0 relied on the [varlink library](https://github.com/varlink/libvarlink) to handle the underlying client/server calls from the Podman client to the host where the Podman service was running. The support for the varlink library was greatly reduced in the spring of 2020. This led the Podman team to investigate the use of other client/server technologies and it was decided to develop a RESTful API for Podman using the native Go libraries.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThis new Podman v2.0 RESTful API was released along with Podman v2.0 in June of 2020 and replaces the Podman API v1.0. As of that time the Podman API v1.0 for Podman was considered to be deprecated. The Podman team noted that the Podman v1.0 (varlink) API would be removed from the Podman project in a future release and that a one month notice would be sent to the community before the version of Podman without the v1.0 API was released. This note represents that notice.\\n\\nThe Podman API v1.0 was just recently [removed](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/8400) from the upstream repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/containers/podman) as work has started on the next release of Podman, v3.0. Podman v3.0 is expected to be released on Fedora 33 in late January 2021 and then later next year in RHEL 8.4 and other distributions.\\n\\nAt the same time as the removal of the Podman v1.0 API, the `libpod.conf` file has also been removed and it too will no longer be included with Podman starting in Podman v3.0. The functionality of this file has been replaced by [containers.conf](https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/docs/containers.conf.5.md). If there have been modifications made to the `libpod.conf` file in your environment, you should be able to make the same changes in `containers.conf` and they will be honored.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this notification, please send a note to the Podman [mailing list](https://lists.podman.io/admin/lists/podman.lists.podman.io/) or create an issue on Podman\u2019s [GitHub](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues) repository."},{"id":"/2020/12/09/new","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2020/12/09/new","source":"@site/blog/2020-12-09-new.md","title":"Using Podman and systemd to manage container lifecycle","description":"Ed Haynes has put together a demo of using Podman and systemd to manage a container lifecycle that\'s available","date":"2020-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 9, 2020","tags":[{"label":"containers","permalink":"/blogs/tags/containers"},{"label":"podman","permalink":"/blogs/tags/podman"},{"label":"networking","permalink":"/blogs/tags/networking"},{"label":"pod","permalink":"/blogs/tags/pod"},{"label":"api","permalink":"/blogs/tags/api"},{"label":"kubernetes","permalink":"/blogs/tags/kubernetes"},{"label":"kube","permalink":"/blogs/tags/kube"},{"label":"v2","permalink":"/blogs/tags/v-2"},{"label":"hpc","permalink":"/blogs/tags/hpc"},{"label":"windows","permalink":"/blogs/tags/windows"},{"label":"mac","permalink":"/blogs/tags/mac"}],"readingTime":0.205,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ehaynes"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Using Podman and systemd to manage container lifecycle","layout":"default","author":"ehaynes","categories":["new"],"tags":["containers","podman","networking","pod","api","kubernetes","kube","v2","hpc","windows","mac"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Podman API v1.0 Deprecation and Removal Notice","permalink":"/blogs/2020/12/11/remove-varlink-libpod-conf-notice"},"nextItem":{"title":"Using Podman and systemd to manage container lifecycle","permalink":"/blogs/2020/12/09/podman-systemd-demo"}},"content":"Ed Haynes has put together a demo of using Podman and systemd to manage a container lifecycle that\'s available\\non GitHub.

The workloads have a very long lifecycle, and generally are \\"tied\\" to the edge device. There is a lot of value in containerizing applications on these edge devices, however, as it decouples the application dependencies from the OS and provides a level of isolation between applications. This demo will show how using Podman in conjunction with systemd provides an elegant solution for this sort of use case. In addition, this will be done as a \\"rootless\\" user - a key benefit of Podman that helps keep the device secure.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nFor my demo, I used a minimal Fedora33 install with Podman installed. To simplify my lifecycle (which in industrial can be 10+ years) I want to keep the base OS as minimal and clean as possible and keep all application dependencies in the containers. I will be creating a redis in-memory keystore database as my containerized application and use the \\"podman generate systemd\\" utility to generate the systemd unit file. This file lets systemd know what your policies are for your application - whether it should start at boot or restart when it fails. In my case I want my application available at boot and also want it to restart in case of failure. I enable and start the systemd service with the --user flag, again I don\'t want root access for security reasons on this device.\\n\\nI provide a test script to test the redis container API. While I could have installed the redis-cli on my base Fedora33 OS to do this testing this would violate my desire to keep the base OS as minimal as possible. I pass values to the redis container\'s port via \\"nc\\" to set a key index of \\"frog\\" to 56. I then show via getting that index that the value is properly set. Now for the interesting part. I use pkill to kill the redis database and then show how systemd restarts the failed container. You can also reboot the OS and find your application running at startup.\\n\\nTo tidy things up I provide a cleanup script which stops the service and cleans up the container so you can start the demo from the top if you like.\\n\\nTo run this demo yourself (I\'ve tested on Fedora33, Red Hat 8.3, and Ubuntu 20.10) ensure Podman and git are installed on your OS\\n\\nAlso remember this is all done as a standard user - no root!\\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/edhaynes/podman_systemd_usermode_demo.git\\n\\n```console\\ncd podman_systemd_usermode_demo\\n\\n./launch_redis_container.sh\\n```\\n\\n\\"launch_redis_container.sh\\" launches redis container, adds usermode systemd entry, enables and starts it. You will need to hit \\"q\\" to get out of the shown status.\\n\\nYou should see something like:\\n\\n```console\\nredis_server.service - Podman container-redis_ Loaded: loaded\\n\\n Active: active (running) since Wed 2020-12-09 09:22:40 EST; 1h 58min ago\\n```\\n\\nNow that redis is running you can run the test script that sets a key value, retrieves it, and then kills the redis container. systemd will then restart the container and you can see all is working again. Do this with:\\n\\n```console\\n./test_redis_container.sh\\n```\\n\\nOnce you are done experimenting with it you can run the cleanup script to stop the systemd service, remove it and stop / remove the container.\\n\\n```console\\n./cleanup.sh\\n```\\n\\nHope you enjoyed this demo and any comments or suggestions please make them in the [GitHub](https://github.com/edhaynes/podman_systemd_usermode_demo.git) repository."},{"id":"/2020/12/07/new","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2020/12/07/new","source":"@site/blog/2020-12-07-new.md","title":"Podman Posts of Interest","description":"I\'ve run across a number of posts over the past few weeks concerning Podman and have","date":"2020-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 7, 2020","tags":[{"label":"containers","permalink":"/blogs/tags/containers"},{"label":"podman","permalink":"/blogs/tags/podman"},{"label":"networking","permalink":"/blogs/tags/networking"},{"label":"pod","permalink":"/blogs/tags/pod"},{"label":"api","permalink":"/blogs/tags/api"},{"label":"kubernetes","permalink":"/blogs/tags/kubernetes"},{"label":"kube","permalink":"/blogs/tags/kube"},{"label":"v2","permalink":"/blogs/tags/v-2"},{"label":"hpc","permalink":"/blogs/tags/hpc"},{"label":"windows","permalink":"/blogs/tags/windows"},{"label":"mac","permalink":"/blogs/tags/mac"}],"readingTime":0.235,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"tsweeney"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman Posts of Interest","layout":"default","author":"tsweeney","categories":["new"],"tags":["containers","podman","networking","pod","api","kubernetes","kube","v2","hpc","windows","mac"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Using Podman and systemd to manage container lifecycle","permalink":"/blogs/2020/12/09/podman-systemd-demo"},"nextItem":{"title":"Podman Posts of Interest","permalink":"/blogs/2020/12/07/podman-posts-of-interests"}},"content":"I\'ve run across a number of posts over the past few weeks concerning Podman and have\\nbeen busy getting other work done.

This is a medium-severity information disclosure vulnerability that affects containers created using Podman\u2019s Varlink API or the Docker-compatible version of its REST API. If two or more containers are created using these APIs, and the first container had environment variables added to it when it was created, all subsequent containers created using the Varlink or Docker-compatible REST APIs will also have these environment variables added. This effect does not persist after restarting the Podman API service.\\n\\nPodman v2.0.5 and higher contain a fix for the CVE. If you use either of these APIs, please update to Podman v2.0.5 or later.

If I couldn\'t be a fireman like my father, I wanted to be an astronaut. Of course I had to have a [Major Matt Mason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNoiDT0BMw&list=LLTdXWmg018se8aJN4cUq6Ag&index=2934) figure so I could fly him around the house and then land him softly in a jury-rigged parachute in my wading pool. Then of course the whole Apollo 13 drama had me riveted, and when the movie came out years later, I fell in love with this line in the movie, \\"Let\'s work the problem people. Let\'s not make things worse by guessing.\\" by Ed Harris who played Gene Kranz the \\"vested\\" flight director.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThat\'s been a helpful creed for me and it\'s also helpful for the Podman world too. Many times the community spends a fair amount of effort answering issues and questions either in GitHub\'s [issues](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues) or in the [Podman Mailing List](https://lists.podman.io/admin/lists/podman.lists.podman.io/). That\'s really great, but sometimes the discussion finds that the problem is concerning an issue that is on the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md). This page might be one of the least visited pages on the site, yet the most helpful, especially for people who are new to the Podman project.\\n\\nThe page contains a number of common issues and solutions for Podman. It can help people who are running into issues find out if the issue has been encountered before. Some of the more common ones are issues with mounts and selinux, rootless containers not being able to ping the host, rootless containers exiting with the user, and more. A lot of the items of the page are not really issues with the Podman software, but rather that required configuration steps for use cases were not completed. Along with the problem and typical error responses on this page, each one has a solution section that will walk you through the steps needed to correct the problem. As common problems are encountered along the way, the community is encouraged to add them to the troubleshooting page, keeping it a fresh source of information.\\n\\nHopefully this post will help users of Podman find and discover solutions to their problems more easily in the Podman Troubleshooting Guide. Just as importantly, it will act as a reminder for those in the community who are familiar with the page to consider adding problems and solutions that they may encounter. As we move forward, effective use of this page will help us prove Gene Kranz right in the Podman universe, \\"Failure is not an option\\"."},{"id":"/2020/08/13/new","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2020/08/13/new","source":"@site/blog/2020-08-13-new.md","title":"Learning Red Hat\'s Podman (docker), Buildah, Skopeo and Quay.io","description":"Four engineers at IBM and Red Hat, JJ Asghar, Brian Tannous, Jason Dobies and Cedric Clyburn spent some time in a stream learning about Podman, Buildah, Skopeo from the ground up in this video blog post.

While it might\\nbe interesting to interact with a RESTFul server using curl,\\nusing a set of Go based bindings is probably a more direct\\nroute to a production ready application. Let\u2019s take a look\\nat how easily that can be accomplished.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nIf you haven\'t yet, [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).\\n\\nBe careful to double-check that the version of golang is new\\nenough (i.e. `go version`), version 1.13.x or higher is\\nsupported. If needed, Go sources and binaries can be fetched\\nfrom the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).\\n\\nThe Podman Go bindings are a set of functions to allow\\ndevelopers to execute Podman operations from within their Go\\nbased application. The Go bindings connect to a Podman service\\nwhich can run locally or on a remote machine. You can perform\\nmany operations including pulling and listing images, starting,\\nstopping or inspecting containers. Currently, the Podman\\nrepository has bindings available for operations on images,\\ncontainers, pods, networks and manifests among others. The\\nbindings are available on the [v2.0 branch in the\\nupstream Podman repository](https://github.com/containers/podman/tree/v2.0).\\nYou can fetch the bindings for your application using Go modules:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ cd $HOME\\n$ mkdir example && cd example\\n$ go mod init example.com\\ngo: creating new go.mod: module example.com\\n$ go get github.com/containers/podman/v2@v2.0.4\\ngo: downloading github.com/containers/podman/v2 v2.0.4\\ngo get: github.com/containers/podman/v2@v2.0.4: parsing go.mod:\\n    module declares its path as: github.com/containers/libpod/v2\\n            but was required as: github.com/containers/podman/v2\\n```\\n\\nThis creates a new `go.mod` file in the current directory that looks as follows:\\n\\n```bash\\nmodule example.com\\n\\ngo 1.14\\n\\nrequire github.com/containers/libpod/v2 v2.0.4 // indirect\\n```\\n\\nYou can also try a demo application with the Go modules created already:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ git clone https://github.com/containers/Demos\\n$ cd Demos/podman_go_bindings\\n$ ls\\nREADME.md  go.mod  go.sum  main.go\\n```\\n\\n## How do I use them\\n\\nIn this tutorial, you will learn through basic examples how to:\\n\\n0. [Start the Podman system service](#start-service)\\n1. [Connect to the Podman system service](#connect-service)\\n2. [Pull images](#pull-images)\\n3. [List images](#list-images)\\n4. [Create and start a container from an image](#create-start-container)\\n5. [List containers](#list-containers)\\n6. [Inspect the container](#inspect-container)\\n7. [Stop the container](#stop-container)\\n8. [Debugging tips](#debugging-tips)\\n\\n### Start the Podman system service <a name=\\"start-service\\"></a>\\n\\nThe recommended way to start Podman system service in production mode\\nis via systemd socket-activation:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ systemctl --user start podman.socket\\n```\\n\\nThere\u2019s no timeout specified when starting the system service via socket-activation.\\n\\nFor purposes of this demo, we will start the service using the Podman\\ncommand itself. If you prefer the system service to timeout after, say,\\n5000 seconds, you can run it like so:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ podman system service -t 5000\\n```\\n\\nNote that the 5000 seconds uptime is refreshed after every command is received.\\nIf you want the service to stay up until the machine is shutdown or the process\\nis terminated, use `0` (zero) instead of 5000. For this demo, we will use no timeout:\\n\\n```bash\\n# -t 0 implies no timeout, default timeout 5 seconds\\n$ podman system service -t 0\\n```\\n\\nOpen another terminal window and check if the Podman socket exists:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ ls /run/user/${UID}/podman\\npodman.sock\\n```\\n\\nIf you\u2019re running the system service as root, podman.sock will be found in /run/podman:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ ls /run/podman\\npodman.sock\\n```\\n\\n### Connect to the Podman system service <a name=\\"connect-service\\"></a>\\n\\nFirst, you need to create a connection that connects to the system service.\\nThe critical piece of information for setting up a new connection is the endpoint.\\nThe endpoint comes in the form of an URI (method:/path/to/socket). For example,\\nto connect to the local rootful socket the URI would be `unix:/run/podman/podman.sock`\\nand for a rootless user it would be `unix:$(XDG_RUNTIME_DIR)/podman/podman.sock`,\\ntypically: `unix:/run/user/${UID}/podman/podman.sock`.\\n\\nThe following Go example snippet shows how to set up a connection for a rootless user.\\n\\n```Go\\npackage main\\n\\nimport (\\n        \\"context\\"\\n        \\"fmt\\"\\n        \\"os\\"\\n\\n        \\"github.com/containers/libpod/v2/libpod/define\\"\\n        \\"github.com/containers/libpod/v2/pkg/bindings\\"\\n        \\"github.com/containers/libpod/v2/pkg/bindings/containers\\"\\n        \\"github.com/containers/libpod/v2/pkg/bindings/images\\"\\n        \\"github.com/containers/libpod/v2/pkg/domain/entities\\"\\n        \\"github.com/containers/libpod/v2/pkg/specgen\\"\\n)\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n        fmt.Println(\\"Welcome to the Podman Go bindings tutorial\\")\\n\\n        // Get Podman socket location\\n        sock_dir := os.Getenv(\\"XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\\")\\n        socket := \\"unix:\\" + sock_dir + \\"/podman/podman.sock\\"\\n\\n        // Connect to Podman socket\\n        connText, err := bindings.NewConnection(context.Background(), socket)\\n        if err != nil {\\n                fmt.Println(err)\\n                os.Exit(1)\\n        }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe `connText` variable received from the NewConnection function is of type\\ncontext.Context().

About one year ago, the Podman team was notified that the focus on the varlink library was being greatly reduced and there would be no further development and little support for it from the varlink library team. This led the Podman team to investigate the use of other client/server technologies and it was decided to develop a RESTful API for Podman using the native Go libraries.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThis new Podman v2.0 RESTful API was released along with Podman v2.0 in June of 2020 and replaces the Podman API v1.0. As of that time the Podman API v1.0 for Podman is considered to be deprecated. If there are issues with the Podman API v1.0 in versions of Podman prior to v2.0 and those versions are still under support on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), the Podman team will make a best effort to address those issues. However, no new feature requests for the API v1.0 will be considered and any problems found with the API v1.0 in Podman v2.0 will not be addressed.\\n\\nThe new Podman v2.0 RESTful API is split into two halves: one providing a Docker-compatible API, and a Libpod API providing support for Podman\u2019s unique features such as pods. The new API works in both a rootful and a rootless environment. It is a much more flexible solution and Podman will not have a dependency on another project in order to supply an API. For more information on the Podman v2.0 RESTful API please see articles on the [podman.io](https://podman.io/) site and also the documentation for the Podman v2.0 RESTful API [here](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Reference.html).\\n\\nDistributions have to support services for the length of their support agreements. The Podman development team wants to be free to update the version of Podman during this support cycle. Therefore, we are planning to drop support for Podman API v1.0 from distributions Red Hat is the packagers for. The version of Podman, 2.\\\\*, which is contained in Fedora 33, scheduled to be released around Oct 31, 2020, will ship with no varlink support. We also plan to drop support from the RHEL8.4 release, spring 2021. Other distributions like OpenSUSE have already disabled varlink support and we have heard that other distributions will follow suit.\\n\\nThis also serves as a notification that the Podman v1.0 (varlink) API will be removed from the main GitHub branch of Podman in the near future. With the release of Podman v2.0 the Podman developers deprecated the Podman API v1.0 in favor of the new Podman v2.0 RESTful API. The plan is to remove varlink completely from the Podman v3.0 development branch which will be created some time after September 2020. A 30 day notification of the final removal date will be posted on the [podman.io](https://podman.io) site and also on the [Podman mailing list](https://lists.podman.io/admin/lists/podman.lists.podman.io/), along with social media once it is definitively determined.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this notification, please send a note to the Podman mailing list or create an issue on Podman\u2019s [GitHub](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues) repository."},{"id":"/2020/08/01/new","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2020/08/01/new","source":"@site/blog/2020-08-01-new.md","title":"Podman API v1.0 Deprecation and Removal Notice","description":"A Podman API v1.0 Deprecation and Removal Notice has just been posted.

Read on to find out why, and how it will affect you.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThree years ago, we created a new Git repository to hold our new container-management tool and the library it was based on. At the time, Podman was not named Podman, but `kpod` - a name no one on the team liked, and one we\u2019d hoped to replace quickly. Given this, we decided to name the repository after the library we\u2019d written to manage containers - `libpod`. Four months after that, we made the first public release of the tool, and with it came a new name - Podman (POD MANager). The rest is, as they say, history. The Podman team is incredibly grateful for the success we\u2019ve seen since then, and the way that the community has grown.\\n\\nWith the release of Podman 2.0, we decided it was a good time to for the rename our repository to better match how it\u2019s used today. We\u2019ve decided to rename our Github repository from `containers/libpod` to `containers/podman`. The `libpod` name made sense when we first made the repository, but it hasn\u2019t been the focus of development for some time. We\u2019ve actually been considering moving the `libpod` library into a separate repository, to make it easier to include in our other tools (and it would be very confusing for `containers/libpod` to not include `libpod`!). Given this, and the fact that there are far more users of Podman the tool than `libpod` the library, renaming the repository makes a great deal of sense.\\n\\nFinally, this rename helps make the repository more discoverable - it\u2019s hard for a new Podman user to know that issues should be filed against `containers/libpod` since they probably don\u2019t know what `libpod` is.\\n\\nWe don\u2019t expect this move will break anyone\u2019s workflow. Github will ensure that the old URLs redirect to the new location, so access to the repo itself, as well as our issues and pull requests, should be unaffected."},{"id":"/2020/07/01/new","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2020/07/01/new","source":"@site/blog/2020-07-01-new.md","title":"Podman REST API and Docker compatibility","description":"Matt Heon talks about the compatibility of the new Podman REST API and Docker\'s API is this blog post.","date":"2020-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 1, 2020","tags":[{"label":"containers","permalink":"/blogs/tags/containers"},{"label":"podman","permalink":"/blogs/tags/podman"},{"label":"networking","permalink":"/blogs/tags/networking"},{"label":"pod","permalink":"/blogs/tags/pod"},{"label":"api","permalink":"/blogs/tags/api"},{"label":"rest","permalink":"/blogs/tags/rest"},{"label":"rest-api","permalink":"/blogs/tags/rest-api"},{"label":"v2","permalink":"/blogs/tags/v-2"},{"label":"hpc","permalink":"/blogs/tags/hpc"}],"readingTime":0.095,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"mheon"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman REST API and Docker compatibility","layout":"default","author":"mheon","categories":["new"],"tags":["containers","podman","networking","pod","api","rest","rest-api","v2","hpc"]},"prevItem":{"title":"The Podman repository has been renamed","permalink":"/blogs/2020/07/07/repo-rename"},"nextItem":{"title":"Podman REST API and Docker compatibility","permalink":"/blogs/2020/07/01/rest-versioning"}},"content":"Matt Heon talks about the compatibility of the new Podman REST API and Docker\'s API is this blog [post](https://podman.io/blogs/2020/07/01/rest-versioning.html)."},{"id":"/2020/07/01/rest-versioning","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2020/07/01/rest-versioning","source":"@site/blog/2020-07-01-rest-versioning.md","title":"Podman REST API and Docker compatibility","description":"podman logo","date":"2020-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 1, 2020","tags":[{"label":"podman","permalink":"/blogs/tags/podman"},{"label":"containers","permalink":"/blogs/tags/containers"},{"label":"api","permalink":"/blogs/tags/api"},{"label":"rest-api","permalink":"/blogs/tags/rest-api"},{"label":"hpc","permalink":"/blogs/tags/hpc"},{"label":"rest","permalink":"/blogs/tags/rest"},{"label":"v2","permalink":"/blogs/tags/v-2"}],"readingTime":1.835,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"mheon"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman REST API and Docker compatibility","layout":"default","author":"mheon","categories":["blogs"],"tags":["podman","containers","api","rest-api","hpc","rest","v2"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Podman REST API and Docker compatibility","permalink":"/blogs/2020/07/01/new"},"nextItem":{"title":"Announcing Podman v2.0","permalink":"/blogs/2020/06/29/new"}},"content":"![podman logo](../static/vectors/raw/podman.svg)\\n\\n# Podman REST API and Docker compatibility\\n\\n## By Matthew Heon [GitHub](https://github.com/mheon)\\n\\n## Versioning the REST API\\n\\nPodman v2.0.0 launched recently, and with it the REST API. We\u2019ve seen a great deal of excitement with this new API because of what it will enable - enabling applications and automation to use Podman when the could previously only use Docker. As you may know, Podman\u2019s REST API is split into two halves: one providing a Docker-compatible API, and a Libpod API providing support for Podman\u2019s unique features such as pods. We would love for all projects to eventually grow to support for our native Libpod API, but this will take time (and may be impossible for older, no longer maintained projects). As such, we need to talk about the Compatibility API and how it can be used.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWhen we developed the compatibility API layer, we targeted the latest released version of the Docker API, v1.40. Within this version, we aimed to implement all endpoints, with the exception of those used for Swarm([^1]). Podman is not a tool for managing clusters, and does not intend to become one. We recognize that many existing tools do not target this specific Docker API version, and these are occasionally breaking changes in the Docker API that may make using the newest API impossible. The core Podman team cannot commit to being bug-for-bug compatible with every version of the Docker API. The Podman team commits to fixing bugs related to the latest version of Docker API. We may fix bugs with older versions that affect many users. As a community project, we gladly accept help here - if you find bugs that prevent Podman from working with a specific API version you use and are willing to fix them, we\u2019re always happy to accept patches!\\n\\nWe\u2019re very excited by the possibilities the new Podman API offers, and encourage everyone to try it out.

Today, we have made the first release of Podman 2 upstream. The release notes highlight many of the newest features but we wanted to call out some specific things in this blog and expand on them.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## \u201cPay no attention to the man behind the curtain\u201d\\n\\nMost of the changes to the new Podman should be transparent to end users. We did a significant amount of replumbing in our internals to allow for future enhancements and more closely align many of the code paths. There are some subtle changes to the outputs of some commands and fields within JSON formatted responses. They were largely done to create more consistency amongst our commands as well as driven by user feedback.\\n\\n## RESTful API\\n\\nThe biggest change in Podman 2 is our introduction of a RESTful API to interact with our libraries. In actuality, the RESTful service was present in earlier versions but was tagged experimental. We have also deprecated the previous API implementation based on varlink. We will publish more specific blogs and tutorials on how to use the API but consider this a little introduction.\\n\\nThe API was designed to have two layers: libpod and compatibility. The libpod layer allows you to interact directly with the libpod libraries. The compatibility layer is designed to emulate the Docker RESTful API to assist in migration of tools, applications, and services long-term to libpod. This can be made clearer with an example. Consider inspecting a container called \u2018foobar\u2019 with each layer. The endpoint paths would differ depending on the layers.\\n\\n```\\n/v1.24/containers/foobar   \u2190 compatibility call\\n/v1.0/libpod/containers/foobar  \u2190 libpod call\\n```\\n\\nFurthermore, the results of each call will differ. The compatibility result will closely emulate the response from Docker.\\n\\nOur preference is that people writing new code to interact with Podman should use the libpod layer only. This is a more sound long term strategy. But for people that need to migrate to Podman, the compatibility layer allows for a quick on-boarding. There are of course Docker endpoints we cannot or choose not to emulate due to incompatibities between Docker and Podman. Nevertheless, we have already seen some field success in migration of applications.\\n\\nIn keeping with Podman\u2019s history the restful API will work in both rootless and rootful mode. If you run in rootful mode, the podman service will listen on `/run/podman/podman.sock` and rootless is `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock` (for example: `/run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock`). If you install the podman-docker package, the package will set up a link between `run/docker/docker.sock` and `/run/podman/podman.sock`.\\n\\n## Remote clients\\n\\nOne of the consequences of our re-plumbing work is that our remote clients for Windows, Mac, and Linux are significantly smaller in size. The interface for the remote client connection has also changed to more of a URI format. As a matter of process, we attach a binary version of the remote clients to each release.\\n\\nIt is also worth noting that a \u2018--remote\u2019 flag has been added to the Podman binary to allow it to act as a remote client.\\n\\n## Auto-update\\n\\nThe `podman auto-update` command allows for updating systemd-managed running containers when their images have been updated on the container registry. While it is still a tech preview in Podman v2.0, we added a number of improvements to better support authentication and to select the correct images on ARM. If you\u2019re interested in auto updates, please check them out and let us know what you think.\\n\\n## systemd Integration Improvements\\n\\nA major improvement for Podman\u2019s systemd support is that `podman generate systemd` now supports using the `--new` flag on pods. This allows for creating shareable systemd units not only for containers but also for pods. Additionally, we added a number of changes to make the systemd units more robust and reliable, such as cleanly starting after a system crash and clean shutdowns even when conmon has been killed. The names of generated files can further be altered with the new `--container-prefix` and `--pod-prefix` flags.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis is a major new version of Podman with the goal to support all of your local container engine needs. We sincerely hope that the new features meet your needs. We continue to develop new content based on the API including new bits to the API itself. Before making too many more changes, we will let Podman \u201cbake\u201d for a while before the next radical functions are added.\\n\\nWe would love to hear your feedback and look forward to working with the community on giving Podman users and developers the best container experience. Remember upstream Podman development usually hangs out on **#podman** on **Freenode** and on the Podman [mailing list](https://lists.podman.io/admin/lists/podman.lists.podman.io/)."},{"id":"/2020/05/13/new","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2020/05/13/new","source":"@site/blog/2020-05-13-new.md","title":"Update on Podman v2","description":"The local Podman v2 client is complete.

In the announcement, we mentioned that the state of upstream code would be jumbled for a while and that we would be temporarily disabling many of our CI/CD tests. The upstream development team has been hard at work, and we are starting to see that work pay off.\\n\\nToday, we are very excited to announce:\\n\\n**The local Podman v2 client is complete. It is passing all of its rootful and rootless system and integration tests.**\\n\\nThe CI/CID tests have been re-enabled upstream and are run with each pull request submission. We are now hard at work finishing up some of the core podman-remote functions. Once those functions are complete, we can then begin to run our podman-remote system and integration tests to catch any regressions.\\n\\nWe have re-enabled the autobuilds for Podman v2 in Fedora rawhide. As mentioned earlier, the Podman remote client is not complete, so that binary is temporarily being removed from the RPM. It will be re-added when the remote client is complete. As a corollary, the Windows and OS/X clients are also not being compiled or tested. This will occur once the remote client for Linux is complete.\\n\\nWe encourage you to pull the latest upstream Podman code and exercise it with your use cases to help us protect against regressions from Podman v1. We hope to make a full Podman v2.0 release in several weeks, once we are confident it is stable. We look forward to hearing what you think, and please do not hesitate to raise issues and comments on this in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues), our Freenode IRC channel `#podman`, or to the Podman mailing list.\\n\\nWe\u2019re very excited to bring Podman v2.0 to you as it offers a lot more flexibility through it\u2019s new REST API interface and adds several enhancements to the existing commands. If your project builds on top of Podman, we would especially love to have you test this new version out so we can ensure complete compatibility with Podman v1.0 and address any issues found ASAP.\\n\\n**Note:** This announcement was first released to the Podman mailing list.

We often referred to it as _apiv2_ and for about a month, there has been an \'apiv2\' branch for libpod on GitHub. This week, we have begun to merge that branch but have yet to \u201cwire it up.\u201d\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Golang libpod API remains largely unchanged. What is changing is the API we expose for automation and remote usage. Our previous API was based on the [varlink](https://varlink.org/) protocol. But we heard from users that varlink was a hurdle for libpod adoption especially for those who were using the Docker API and its bindings. They simply could not or did not want to rewrite their custom applications for libpod\u2019s new, varlink-based API.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThe new API is a simpler implementation based on HTTP/REST. We provide two basic groups of endpoints. The first one is for libpod; the second is for Docker compatibility, to ease adoption. The two endpoints are namespaced to keep them separate. Our goal with implementing a portion of the Docker API, is to be as compatible as possible; while similar calls in the libpod API might bring back additional libpod specific information.\\n\\nWhile these two endpoints work similarly, there are important and somewhat nuanced differences. The Docker API endpoint is useful for existing automation tied to that API and potentially tools like docker-compose.\\n\\n#### Example\\n\\nIf you wanted a list of images with the libpod endpoint, you would use the following endpoint:\\n\\n`<endpoint_base_url>/libpod/images/json`\\n\\nAnd if you wanted a list of images but in docker-compatibility, you would use:\\n\\n`<endpoint_base_url>/images/json`\\n\\nIn our proof of concepts, we have tested our endpoint with the [docker-py](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) project. There are of course subtle differences which we are still working on. And there are compatibility endpoints that we can not support like `swarm` which Podman does not support.\\n\\nWe are working on a set of Golang bindings for the libpod endpoints. Eventually these bindings will be used to rewire our remote client. The rewire begins after all the libpod endpoints are working and have tests. We plan on working with the upstream community on podman-python support for the new libpod API, enabling python developers fully support for using podman containers.\\n\\nAs for the existing varlink code, it has been in maintenance mode already. We will continue to address bugs but no new functionality will be developed. Once the new API is fully implemented, we plan to make a deprecation announcement.\\n\\nWe are hopeful these changes help our users and larger community. We hope that the new API helps encourage contributors to help us complete the API as well as write bindings. Look for more information in the near future including status updates as well as how-tos."},{"id":"/2020/01/15/bioinformatics-with-rootless-podman","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2020/01/15/bioinformatics-with-rootless-podman","source":"@site/blog/2020-01-15-bioinformatics-with-rootless-podman.md","title":"Bioinformatics with rootless Podman","description":"podman logo","date":"2020-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 15, 2020","tags":[{"label":"bioinformatics","permalink":"/blogs/tags/bioinformatics"},{"label":"rootless","permalink":"/blogs/tags/rootless"},{"label":"podman","permalink":"/blogs/tags/podman"}],"readingTime":9.82,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"bhepworth"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Bioinformatics with rootless Podman","layout":"default","author":"bhepworth","categories":["blogs"],"tags":["bioinformatics","rootless","podman"]},"prevItem":{"title":"New API coming for Podman","permalink":"/blogs/2020/01/17/podman-new-api"},"nextItem":{"title":"Bioinformatics and rootless containers with Podman","permalink":"/blogs/2020/01/15/new"}},"content":"![podman logo](../static/vectors/raw/podman.svg)\\n\\n# Bioinformatics with rootless podman\\n\\n## By Valentin Rothberg [GitHub](https://github.com/BryanHepworth)\\n\\nOver the last 10 years I\'ve seen machines and workflows evolve where I work. From the initial dedicated server, to hpc environments\\nand now the latest instance, containers.\\n\\nFrom an admin point of view this is great - The initial servers had to be carefully built and maintained so that everything would work nicely together. Incompatible programs at that time were run through a VM until such time as they could be folded in to the mix.\\n\\nThe HPC\'s had versioned software and environment modules and were built to load the relevant dependencies at run time.\\n\\nNow we are into a new era, containers - and not just any old containers, but containers that end users can build and run up fairly\\nquickly to perform what-if\'s, and move on quickly through iterations until they perform the required functions.\\n\\nPodman has developed very rapidly and is incredibly easy to use. You can use it in conjunction with quay.io or run it on a local machine.\\n\\nI should add that Adrian Reber gave a [talk](https://youtu.be/TtHSNsbU24E) and has also created a Podman [article](https://podman.io/blogs/2019/09/26/podman-in-hpc.html) using openhpc; well worth a watch and a read.\\n\\nIf you don\'t have a RedHat Developer Subscription now is an ideal time to get one:\\n\\nhttps://developers.redhat.com/articles/getting-red-hat-developer-subscription-what-rhel-users-need-know/\\n\\n..and download RedHat Enterprise 8.1\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nDo a Standard RedHat GUI Server default install\\n\\n```\\nyum update\\nyum module install container-tools\\n```\\n\\nRedHat 8.1 does rootless containers right out of the box. If you created a user during the setup, it\'ll have the details in /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid already.\\n\\nLog in with your userID and you can start creating a container\\n\\n```\\npodman pull ubi8/ubi\\npodman run --interactive --tty ubi8/ubi bash\\n```\\n\\nThe first command pulls down the ubi8 Universal Base Image, which is a great building block. The second command starts an interactive ubi8 image at a bash prompt. You can run any commands you like in this:\\n\\n```\\n[nbh23@colombo ~]$ podman run --interactive --tty ubi8/ubi bash\\n[root@f471459c7619 /]# cat /etc/redhat-release\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.1 (Ootpa)\\n[root@f471459c7619 /]#\\n\\n```\\n\\nNotice how the prompt changed from nbh23@colombo to root@f471459c7619 - the f471459c7619 is the part to remember, we\'ll interact with that later on in this post. It\'s a random allocation, so your instance will be different.\\n\\nThe Podman help menu\'s are excellent, podman -h gives you a list of subcommands, which you can then also query:\\n\\n```\\n[nbh23@colombo ~]$ podman -h\\nmanage pods and images\\n\\nUsage:\\n  podman [flags]\\n  podman [command]\\n\\nAvailable Commands:\\n  attach      Attach to a running container\\n

creating a new image?\\nI found that Podman is very easy to interact with and created a Dockerfile. This is a list of commands in a text file that controls what gets installed.\\nCreate a new directory - in this case whatshap, to put the Dockerfile in:\\n\\n```\\n[nbh23@colombo whatshap]$ cat Dockerfile\\nFROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi\\nRUN yum -y update \\\\\\n&& yum -y install python3 \\\\\\n&& yum -y install make \\\\\\n&& yum -y install gcc \\\\\\n&& yum -y install redhat-rpm-config \\\\\\n&& yum -y install zlib-devel \\\\\\n&& yum -y install bzip2-devel \\\\\\n&& yum -y install xz-devel \\\\\\n&& yum -y install python3-devel \\\\\\n&& yum clean all\\nRUN pip3 install pysam && pip3 install whatshap\\n```\\n\\nThen we build the container image - from within the whatshap directory run:\\n\\n```\\npodman build -t whatshap .\\n```\\n\\nNotice the \'.\' at the end, that\'s important!\\n\\nYou\'ll see the container image start to build, with notifications of where it\'s at. If all goes to plan you will then finally see notification that it\'s completed:\\n\\n```\\nSTEP 4: COMMIT whatshap\\nd523727fc6c297086e84e7ec99f62e8f5e6d093d9decb1b58ee8a4205d46b3dd\\n```\\n\\nWe can then check it works:\\n\\n```\\n[nbh23@colombo whatshap]$ podman run -it whatshap\\n[root@ac05564bd51b /]# whatshap -h\\nusage: whatshap [-h] [--version] [--debug]\\n                {phase,stats,compare,hapcut2vcf,unphase,haplotag,genotype} ...\\n\\npositional arguments:\\n  {phase,stats,compare,hapcut2vcf,unphase,haplotag,genotype}\\n    phase               Phase variants in a VCF with the WhatsHap algorithm\\n    stats               Print phasing statistics of a single VCF file\\n    compare             Compare two or more phasings\\n    hapcut2vcf          Convert hapCUT output format to VCF\\n    unphase             Remove phasing information from a VCF file\\n    haplotag            Tag reads by haplotype\\n    genotype            Genotype variants\\n\\noptional arguments:\\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\\n  --version             show program\'s version number and exit\\n  --debug               Print debug messages\\n[root@ac05564bd51b /]#\\n```\\n\\nWhich all looks good - we now have our container image and can re-run that to do our whatshap analysis.\\n\\nAll well and good, but what happens about storage of that analysis?\\n\\nWe can add that to our Podman command, if we have a directory called data in /home we can map that as follows:\\n\\n```\\npodman run -v /home/nbh23/data:/home/nbh23:z -it whatshap\\n```\\n\\nThe nice thing is that the UID and GID for files created this way all match up. The trailing :z makes selinux happy :-)\\n\\n```\\n[nbh23@colombo whatshap]$ podman run -v /home/nbh23/data:/home/nbh23:z -it whatshap\\n[root@fef561d523b8 /]# ls\\nbin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var\\n[root@fef561d523b8 /]# cd /home\\n[root@fef561d523b8 home]# ls\\nnbh23\\n[root@fef561d523b8 home]# cd nbh23\\n[root@fef561d523b8 nbh23]# touch testfile\\n[root@fef561d523b8 nbh23]# ls -la\\ntotal 0\\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 root root 22 Jan 21 09:09 .\\ndrwxr-xr-x. 3 root root 19 Jan 21 09:09 ..\\n-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  0 Jan 21 09:09 testfile\\n[root@fef561d523b8 nbh23]# exit\\n[nbh23@colombo ~]$ ls\\nContainers  data  Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos\\n[nbh23@colombo ~]$ cd data\\n[nbh23@colombo data]$ ls -la\\ntotal 4\\ndrwxrwxr-x.  2 nbh23 nbh23   22 Jan 21 09:09 .\\ndrwx------. 17 nbh23 nbh23 4096 Jan 21 09:07 ..\\n-rw-r--r--.  1 nbh23 nbh23    0 Jan 21 09:09 testfile\\n[nbh23@colombo data]$\\n```\\n\\nOne of the things I discovered whilst creating a more complex container image was that you can start the existing image into a bash session, doing the manipulation that you require, and then use the Podman commit command to write those changes.\\nFor example using our whatshap container image we can run it as follows:\\n\\n```\\n[nbh23@colombo data]$ podman run -it whatshap bash\\n[root@73c4742e4724 /]#\\n```\\n\\nWe can then make our alterations, and from another session commit those changes:\\n\\n```\\n[nbh23@colombo ~]$ podman commit 73c4742e4724 whatshap-altered\\nGetting image source signatures\\nCopying blob c630f5c3e169 skipped: already exists\\nCopying blob 4bd7408cc1c8 skipped: already exists\\nCopying blob 1383f0e3c813 skipped: already exists\\nCopying blob a2ff5e229058 skipped: already exists\\nCopying blob b75bf3e68dab done\\nCopying config 931b7f5302 done\\nWriting manifest to image destination\\nStoring signatures\\n931b7f5302af9965bff14e460c19ff9e756d74095940c6d85e63f929006c35f0\\n[nbh23@colombo ~]$\\n```\\n\\nThen do podman image list to see what we have:\\n\\n```\\n[nbh23@colombo ~]$ podman image list\\nREPOSITORY                            TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE\\nlocalhost/whatshap-altered            latest   931b7f5302af   About a minute ago   545 MB\\nlocalhost/whatshap                    latest   d523727fc6c2   3 days ago           545 MB\\nregistry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi   latest   096cae65a207   5 weeks ago          239\\n[nbh23@colombo ~]$\\n```\\n\\nYou can make multiple changes to your original container image until you are satisfied that it\'s working as you\'d like.\\n\\nThis has covered command line container image creation and usage, I\'ll be creating another blog post detailing graphical interactive containers as i\'m aware that there are various interactive visual programs to cover too.\\n\\nFeel free to contact me with any ideas or suggestions / questions."},{"id":"/2020/01/15/new","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2020/01/15/new","source":"@site/blog/2020-01-15-new.md","title":"Bioinformatics and rootless containers with Podman","description":"Bryan Hepworth demonstrating how to create a rootless container image for a Bioinformatics program here.","date":"2020-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 15, 2020","tags":[],"readingTime":0.075,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Bioinformatics and rootless containers with Podman","layout":"default","categories":["new"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Bioinformatics with rootless Podman","permalink":"/blogs/2020/01/15/bioinformatics-with-rootless-podman"},"nextItem":{"title":"Running containers with Podman and shareable systemd services","permalink":"/blogs/2019/12/17/new"}},"content":"Bryan Hepworth demonstrating how to create a rootless container image for a Bioinformatics program [here](https://podman.io/blogs/2020/01/15/bioinformatics-with-rootless-podman.html)."},{"id":"/2019/12/17/new","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2019/12/17/new","source":"@site/blog/2019-12-17-new.md","title":"Running containers with Podman and shareable systemd services","description":"Podman version 1.7 is coming out soon and will include new features that will make management of containers with systemd services even easier.

For this walkthrough I used the root user on the console and the first thing I did was to upgrade my Fedora 30 Virtual Machine (VM) to Fedora 31. If you want to install Fedora 31 directly, the beta version just became available at the time of this writing, you could do that instead. The steps to do the upgrade are:\\n\\n```\\n# dnf -y upgrade --refresh\\n# dnf -y install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade\\n# dnf -y system-upgrade download --releasever=31\\n# dnf system-upgrade reboot\\n```\\n\\nAfter the machine finished rebooting, my VM was running Fedora 31 so now I needed to install Podman with `dnf -y install podman`. After that completes, verify that you have Podman Version 1.6.2 or higher.\\n\\n```\\n# podman version\\nVersion:            1.6.2\\nRemoteAPI Version:  1\\nGo Version:         go1.13.1\\nOS/Arch:            linux/amd64\\n```\\n\\nNow I\u2019m going to follow the steps in the [Basic Setup and Use of Podman in a Rootless environments](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md) tutorial to do the configuration necessary to run rootless containers.\\n\\nPodman running rootless containers does have a few software dependencies. Most if not all of these should be installed for you on Fedora 31 by default, but just to verify I did:\\n\\n```\\n# dnf -y install slirp4netns fuse-overlayfs\\nLast metadata expiration check: 0:02:26 ago on Sat 14 Sep 2019 07:56:03 PM EDT.\\nPackage slirp4netns-0.4.0-20.1.dev.gitbbd6f25.fc31.x86_64 is already installed.\\nPackage fuse-overlayfs-0.6.2-2.git67a4afe.fc31.x86_64 is already installed.\\nDependencies resolved.\\nNothing to do.\\nComplete!\\n```\\n\\nNow the user namespaces need to be setup. Rootless Podman requires the user running it to have a range of UIDs and GIDs listed in the /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid files. These files control which UIDs and GIDs the user is allocated to use on the system. Depending upon how your user was first created, these files may already have entries in them for your user. If so, you don\u2019t need to do anything else. If not, then you can edit either file directly, or you can use `useradd` to create the user and allocate entries in both files, or you can use the `usermod` command to allocate them for a preexisting user. In this example usermod has allocated the values from 10000 to 55537 for the local \u201ctom\u201d account to use in our system.\\n\\n```\\n# usermod -v 10000-65536 -w 10000-65536 tom\\n\\n# cat /etc/subuid\\ntom:10000:55537\\n\\n# cat /etc/subgid\\ntom:10000:55537\\n```\\n\\nIf you have multiple users, you\u2019ll need to be sure that the ranges that are assigned to them in either `/etc/subuid` or `/etc/subgid` don\u2019t overlap or they could gain control of the other persons containers in that overlap.\\n\\nNow we\u2019re done running with a privileged account. From here on out we can run as a non-privileged user, so I next opened up a new terminal and ssh\u2019d into the host using the non-privileged \u2018tom\u2019 account:\\n\\n```\\n$ ssh tom@192.168.122.228\\ntom@192.168.122.228\'s password:\\n```\\n\\nThe first thing to do is to check for the `crun` command.\\n\\n```\\n# whereis crun\\ncrun: /usr/bin/crun /usr/share/man/man1/crun.1.gz\\n```\\n\\nThe `crun` command is the runtime the allows for cgroup V2 support and is supplied starting with Fedora 31. Other container systems use the `runc` runtime. However, runc only supports cgroup V1. The cgroup kernel feature allows you to allocate resources such as CPU time, network bandwidth and system memory to a container. Version 1 of cgroup only supports containers that are run by root, while version 2 supports containers that are run by root or a non-privileged user.\\n\\nA few tweaks to the \u2018tom\u2019 account config files may be needed, in most cases these files will not need tweaking, but let\u2019s verify them. The first up is libpod.conf and to get a default variant of that file, just run `podman info` first.\\n\\n```\\n$ podman info\\n$ vi .config/containers/libpod.conf\\n```\\n\\nAnd if it\u2019s not already set, set the `runtime` option in libpod.conf to \u201ccrun\u201d.\\n\\n```\\nruntime = \\"crun\\"\\n```\\n\\nThen in `.config/containers/storage.conf` make sure the `mount_program = \u201c/usr/bin/fuse-overlayfs\u201d` line is uncommented.\\n\\nJust that easy, you\u2019re ready to run Rootless Podman. See I told you I\u2019m not like those other guys! Let\u2019s try setting up a rootless container running httpd. Let\u2019s create this Dockerfile in the local directory:\\n\\n```\\n$ cat Dockerfile\\nFROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:8.0\\n\\nMAINTAINER Podman Mailing List <podman@lists.podman.io>\\nENV DOCROOT=/var/www/html\\n\\nRUN yum --disableplugin=subscription-manager --nodocs -y install httpd \\\\\\n  && yum --disableplugin=subscription-manager clean all \\\\\\n  && echo \\"Hello from the httpd-parent container!\\" > ${DOCROOT}/index.html\\n\\nEXPOSE 80\\n\\nCMD httpd -D FOREGROUND\\n```\\n\\nAnd now build using it:\\n\\n```\\n$  podman build -t myhttp .\\nSTEP 1: FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:8.0\\nGetting image source signatures\\nCopying blob 641d7cc5cbc4 done\\nCopying blob c65691897a4d done\\nCopying config 11f9dba4d1 done\\nWriting manifest to image destination\\nStoring signatures\\nSTEP 2: MAINTAINER Podman Mailing List <podman@lists.podman.io>\\nbed974e664909b511f14e2cc21a59642c81fd1d958db12d7ef8fdc1e74f3d364\\nSTEP 3: ENV DOCROOT=/var/www/html\\n5eee83e1e640a4aa2c5f39caa11c3a24ec22e37f99633c2ee9912e8f65a5ff81\\nSTEP 4: RUN yum --disableplugin=subscription-manager --nodocs -y install httpd   && yum --disableplugin=subscription-manager clean all   && echo \\"Hello from the httpd-parent container!\\" > ${DOCROOT}/index.html\\nRed Hat Universal Base Image 8 (RPMs) - AppStre 1.0 MB/s | 2.3 MB     00:02\\nRed Hat Universal Base Image 8 (RPMs) - BaseOS  769 kB/s | 754 kB     00:00\\nDependencies resolved.\\n{A number of normal yum output lines removed for brevity}\\nInstalled:\\n  httpd-2.4.37-12.module+el8.0.0+4096+eb40e6da.x86_64\\n  apr-util-openssl-1.6.1-6.el8.x86_64\\n  apr-util-bdb-1.6.1-6.el8.x86_64\\n  apr-1.6.3-9.el8.x86_64\\n  apr-util-1.6.1-6.el8.x86_64\\n  httpd-tools-2.4.37-12.module+el8.0.0+4096+eb40e6da.x86_64\\n  mod_http2-1.11.3-3.module+el8.0.0+4096+eb40e6da.x86_64\\n  httpd-filesystem-2.4.37-12.module+el8.0.0+4096+eb40e6da.noarch\\n  mailcap-2.1.48-3.el8.noarch\\n  redhat-logos-httpd-80.7-1.el8.noarch\\n\\nComplete!\\n16 files removed\\n45fcaaf719615e97190bf38aa9d8d06e5437f0e10741343fd318777647584d6f\\nSTEP 5: EXPOSE 80\\n865abb5a809cb0ffbc63fef2def892595fe54cfeffc67013a0096a5f0fff4b27\\nSTEP 6: CMD httpd -D FOREGROUND\\nSTEP 7: COMMIT myhttp\\nf8d0bf10faa0460a111283a51d95e94421d1a46a21bca7f6f43a762469504593\\n```\\n\\nNow to verify the myhttp image has been created:\\n\\n```\\n$ podman images\\nREPOSITORY                            TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE\\nlocalhost/myhttp                      latest   a76baf5989a3   2 minutes ago   236 MB\\nregistry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi   8.0      11f9dba4d1bc   5 weeks ago     216 MB\\n```\\n\\nLet\u2019s now run our container and check that the http server is responding:\\n\\n```\\n$ podman run --detach --name myhttp_ctr localhost/myhttp 30d8b54f63c5d2a8ecbe30b56546082e32e701a87c98df81ee0d2565ed33db72\\n$ curl localhost\\ncurl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 80: Connection refused\\n```\\n\\nBut wait! Why did the curl command fail rather than return our index.html output from our webserver? That\u2019s because we\u2019re running a rootless container and the user running this container doesn\u2019t have the privilege to connect to the container host\u2019s port 80 for the webserver. So how can we be certain that the webserver is up and running? First let\u2019s see if the container is up:\\n\\n```\\n$ podman ps\\nCONTAINER ID  IMAGE                    COMMAND               CREATED        STATUS            PORTS  NAMES\\n30d8b54f63c5  localhost/myhttp:latest  /bin/sh -c httpd ...  3 minutes ago  Up 3 minutes ago         myhttp_ctr\\n```\\n\\nThe container appears to be up and running. Let\u2019s exec into it and see if we can resolve the web server from inside of the container:\\n\\n```\\n$ podman exec -it myhttp_ctr /bin/bash\\nbash-4.4# curl localhost\\nHello from the httpd-parent container!\\n```\\n\\nWe\u2019ve made contact with our web server from within the container. Granted this is not the most useful example from a real world side of things. However, it does show how a rootless container is able to run while the administrator of the host can build a good secure separation from the rootless container. Rootless containers keep unprivileged users from running or controlling things they should not on the host.\\n\\nSetting up a host to run rootless containers using Podman is a relatively painless process. Out of the box the only thing that may need to be done is to add entries in the /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid files for users that will be running containers. That\u2019s it! We did a little more checking on the files above, but that wasn\u2019t required. Once the user has those entries created for them, they can run containers in their own space without controlling things on the host that they should not. It really is just that easy, and best yet, you didn\u2019t even have to stay up late at night so you could call now \u201cFor just $19.99 we\u2019ll give you rootless containers and if you sign up now, you can run them safely too!\u201d. Instead, rootless containers are there and ready for your use starting in Podman v1.6.2 right now."},{"id":"/2019/10/28/new","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2019/10/28/new","source":"@site/blog/2019-10-28-new.md","title":"Podman and NFS","description":"Adrian Reber wrote up a quick post on \\"Podman and NFS\\" here.

In this article I want to extend my HPC environment to use a shared NFS\\nhome directory.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThe following examples are running on CentOS 7.7 and are\\nconfiguring Podman for rootless usage based on [the official\\ndocumentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/index#running_containers_as_root_or_rootless).\\n\\nThe user in my examples is named _centos_.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ sudo sh -c \\"echo \'user.max_user_namespaces=28633\' > /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf\\"\\n$ sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf\\n$ sudo sh -c \\"echo \'centos:200000:65536\' >> /etc/subuid\\"\\n$ sudo sh -c \\"echo \'centos:200000:65536\' >> /etc/subgid\\"\\n```\\n\\nWith this the system should be ready to run rootless containers. As I am focussing\\non containers running under Open MPI\'s control I am using Podman with _--net=host_,\\nas mentioned in my [previous article](https://podman.io/blogs/2019/09/26/podman-in-hpc.html).\\n\\nDuring system setup I am also configuring Podman to be ready to run on a NFS\\nbased home directory because, as far as I know, it is not possible for Podman\\nto correctly setup the necessary [user\\nnamespaces](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html) when\\nthe storage backend is running on NFS.\\n\\nThe following commands are necessary on my system to tell Podman to use\\n_/tmp/centos/containers_ as the storage backend:\\n\\n```shell\\n$ podman info\\n$ sed -e \\"s,graphroot.*$,graphroot = \\\\\\"/tmp/centos/containers\\\\\\",g\\" -i .config/containers/storage.conf\\n$ rm -f ./.local/share/containers/storage/libpod/bolt_state.db ./.local/share/containers/cache/blob-info-cache-v1.boltdb\\n```\\n\\nThe first command lets Podman create an initial configuration for the current\\nsystem. As the home directory is on a NFS mounted directory it is necessary to\\ntell Podman to use a non NFS directory for backend storage\\n(_/tmp/centos/containers_ in this example). As this happens during initial\\nsystem (or user) configuration and no container has yet been run by Podman I\\ncan easily delete Podman\'s local database which contains reference to the home\\ndirectory as the storage backend. With these 3 steps Podman is ready to be used\\non a NFS based home directory once the user logs in for the first time.\\n\\nI am now running the same Open MPI based container example as in my\\n[previous article](https://podman.io/blogs/2019/09/26/podman-in-hpc.html).\\n\\n```shell\\n$ mpirun --hostfile hostfile \\\\\\n   --mca orte_tmpdir_base /tmp/podman-mpirun \\\\\\n   podman run --env-host \\\\\\n     -v /tmp/podman-mpirun:/tmp/podman-mpirun \\\\\\n     --userns=keep-id \\\\\\n     --net=host --pid=host --ipc=host \\\\\\n     quay.io/adrianreber/mpi-test:30 /home/ring\\nRank 2 has cleared MPI_Init\\nRank 2 has completed ring\\nRank 2 has completed MPI_Barrier\\nRank 3 has cleared MPI_Init\\nRank 3 has completed ring\\nRank 3 has completed MPI_Barrier\\nRank 1 has cleared MPI_Init\\nRank 1 has completed ring\\nRank 1 has completed MPI_Barrier\\nRank 0 has cleared MPI_Init\\nRank 0 has completed ring\\nRank 0 has completed MPI_Barrier\\n```\\n\\nThe difference to the previous article is that my home directory is now NFS\\nbased. Podman will now go to the specified registry (_quay.io_) to download for\\neach host involved in the MPI job the specified container to\\n_/tmp/centos/containers_.\\n\\nThis enables me to use Podman in a even more HPC like environment where shared\\nhome directories are very common to share input and output data."},{"id":"/2019/10/23/Perona-PMM","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2019/10/23/Perona-PMM","source":"@site/blog/2019-10-23-Perona-PMM.md","title":"PMM Server + podman&#58; Running a Container Without root Privileges","description":"podman logo","date":"2019-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 23, 2019","tags":[{"label":"containers","permalink":"/blogs/tags/containers"},{"label":"images","permalink":"/blogs/tags/images"},{"label":"docker","permalink":"/blogs/tags/docker"},{"label":"buildah","permalink":"/blogs/tags/buildah"},{"label":"podman","permalink":"/blogs/tags/podman"},{"label":"oci","permalink":"/blogs/tags/oci"}],"readingTime":0.345,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"tsweeney"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"PMM Server + podman&#58; Running a Container Without root Privileges","layout":"default","author":"tsweeney","categories":["blogs"],"tags":["containers","images","docker","buildah","podman","oci"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Podman and NFS","permalink":"/blogs/2019/10/28/podman-with-nfs"},"nextItem":{"title":"PMM Server + podman&#58; Running a Container Without root Privileges","permalink":"/blogs/2019/10/23/new"}},"content":"![podman logo](../static/vectors/raw/podman.svg)\\n\\n# PMM Server + podman: Running a Container Without root Privileges\\n\\n## By Tom Sweeney [GitHub](https://github.com/TomSweeneyRedhat)\\n\\nCeri Williams talks about how the Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) can be run in a container using Podman without root privileges [here](https://www.percona.com/blog/2019/10/22/pmm-server-podman-running-a-container-without-root-privileges/?utm_campaign=2019%20Blog%20Q4&utm_content=103803368&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-35373186).

They run in the cloud, they run on IoT devices, they run in small and in big companies and wherever they run, we want them to run as securely as possible. In this article, I describe the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) project that [Divyansh Kamboj](https://twitter.com/weirdwiz_), [Dan Walsh](https://twitter.com/rhatdan) and [I](https://twitter.com/vlntnrthbrg) have been working on and how we improved the state of the art in securing containers, and how you can try it out.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n# Background\\n\\nAt [DevConf.cz](https://www.devconf.info/cz/) in early 2019, Dan Walsh and I were talking about container security and how we could improve the status quo in a user-friendly fashion. Among other things, we talked about [seccomp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html), a widely used security feature of Linux. At its very core, seccomp allows for filtering the syscalls invoked by a process and can thereby be used to restrict which syscalls a given process is allowed to execute. Many software projects such as Android, Flatpak, Chrome and Firefox use seccomp to further tighten the security. One threat model seccomp protects against is the damage a malicious process can do. The fewer syscalls are available, the smaller is the attack surface. Hence, an attacker might gain control over some process of a web browser but seccomp will restrict the set of available syscalls to only those it needs. For instance, the syscalls needed for a rendering a website. The reduced attack surface can prevent the attacker from gaining control over the system. This makes seccomp a powerful security tool but while talking about it Dan and I quickly realized there is room for improvement.\\n\\nThe tricky part of security is making it user friendly. A security mechanism should not turn into an annoyance or an obstacle. Otherwise some users will turn it off. Most container tools use a default seccomp filter which was initially written by [Jesse Frazelle](https://twitter.com/jessfraz?lang=de) for Docker. This default filter found a balance between tightening the security while remaining portable to allow most workloads to run without receiving permission errors. The fact that this default filter is used by Docker, Podman, CRI-O, containerd and other tools on millions of deployments around the globe, shows its importance and impact. However, the default filter is pretty loose and it still allows more than 300 of the 435 syscalls on Linux 5.3 x86_64. The high number of available syscalls is essential to support as many containers as possible but according to Aqua Sec, most containers require only [40 to 70 syscalls](https://blog.aquasec.com/aqua-3.2-preventing-container-breakouts-with-dynamic-system-call-profiling). This means that the syscall attack surface of an average container could further be reduced by around 80 percent. But if we want to restrict more syscalls than the default filter, we face the problem of finding out which syscalls a container actually needs. That\u2019s the problem we decided to work on and to ultimately come up with an open-source solution that users can easily use and integrate into their workflows.\\n\\nDan and I started to philosophize about how we wanted to tackle the problem of finding out which syscalls a given container needs. Statically analyzing the code is theoretically optimal as we can determine the exact set of syscalls the program needs. But we quickly run into practical issues where corner cases cannot be covered and where users need a deep understanding of the code and certainly of the limitations of the individual analyzers. Such approaches are also programming-language specific and hence not generally applicable. All in all, static analysis does not provide the level of user friendliness and automation we wanted. Hence, we decided upon runtime analysis and proposed a project for Google Summer of Code under the umbrella of the [Fedora project](https://getfedora.org/). The project proposal was to trace the processes running inside a container and to create a seccomp filter based on the set of recorded syscalls. The proposal was eventually accepted and we are thrilled how far we came thanks to Divyansh Kamboj who worked with us during this summer and who has turned into an active contributor to our [github.com/containers](https://github.com/containers) projects.\\n\\n# Tracing the syscalls of a container\\n\\nAfter some initial experiments with [ptrace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptrace), we were looking for an alternative tracing mechanism. Ptrace has some considerable performance impacts that we were not willing to take, so Divyansh explored the idea of using audit logging of seccomp actions. Since Linux v4.14, the actions of seccomp filters can be recorded in the audit log. Using seccomp to create a new seccomp filter was tempting and the initial experiments have shown promising results until we started to run multiple containers in parallel. We could see and track which syscalls have been used but we could not figure out which process and hence which syscall belongs to which container. The Linux kernel community is currently debating to add an [audit container ID](https://lwn.net/Articles/750313/) which identifies a container in the logs but there is no consensus yet and we do not expect a solution in the near future. We had to find another solution.\\n\\nEventually, we decided to use the [extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)](https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/) for tracing. eBPF allows for writing custom programs that can hook into various code paths in the kernel. These programs can be injected from user space into the kernel who interprets them in a special virtual machine. BPF was originally written to inspect networking packets directly in the kernel to achieve the lowest possible latency and best performance. Nowadays, with eBPF we can inspect many more aspects of the kernel. For our purpose, we hook into the sysenter tracepoint when entering the kernel from user space. This allows us to quickly inspect which syscalls are called by a given process. Although eBPF is fast, we still faced the aforementioned absence of a container concept in the kernel, so we had to find a way to know if a given process is part of the container we want to trace or not. We decided to identify a container by its PID namespace. If the PID namespace of the process we hit in our eBPF program corresponds to the container we are currently tracing, then we record the syscall. Ultimately, if a container creates a new PID namespace, we will not trace processes inside the new namespace and generate an inaccurate filter. But that is pretty much the only limitation.\\n\\n# The OCI seccomp bpf hook\\n\\nWe implemented the syscall tracer as an Open Container Initiative (OCI) [runtime hook](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/config.md#posix-platform-hooks). OCI runtime hooks are called at different stages of the lifecycle of a container and are executed by OCI-compliant container runtimes, such as runc. Runc is used to spawn and run containers, and is the default runtime of Podman, containerd, Docker and many other tools. Our syscall-tracing hook runs at the prestart stage, where the init process of the container is created but not yet started. At this point, we can extract the PID namespace of the container, compile the eBPF program and start it. All this happens before the container is started, so we do not run into a race condition and avoid losing any early syscalls of the container. Once the eBPF program is running, we detach it from the hook and the container runtime can start the container. All source code is open source and can be downloaded from [github.com/containers/oci-seccomp-bpf-hook](https://github.com/containers/oci-seccomp-bpf-hook). We are currently creating packages for Fedora and CentOS and hope to provide packages for more distributions in the near future. In the following, we go through a step-by-step example how the hook can be used in practice.\\n\\nLet\u2019s first install [Podman](https://podman.io/). Podman is a daemonless container engine for running containers and Pods and supports running [rootless containers](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/how-does-rootless-podman-work).\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo dnf install -y podman\\n```\\n\\nNext, we clone the git repository of the OCI seccomp bpf hook to compile and install it. Note that we need to install a few more packages in order to compile the hook.\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo dnf install -y bcc-devel bcc-tools git golang libseccomp-devel golang-github-cpuguy83-md2man make\\n$ git clone https://github.com/containers/oci-seccomp-bpf-hook.git\\n$ cd oci-seccomp-bpf-hook\\n$ make binary\\n$ PREFIX=/usr sudo make install\\n```\\n\\nNow, with the hook being installed we can use Podman to run a container and use the hook for tracing syscalls. eBPF requires root privileges so we cannot make use of Podman\u2019s rootless support while tracing. However, we can use the generated seccomp profiles for running the workloads in a rootless container.\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo podman run --annotation io.containers.trace-syscall=of:/tmp/ls.json fedora:30 ls / > /dev/null\\n```\\n\\nIn the upper example, we are running ls in a fedora:30 container. The annotation io.containers.trace-syscall is used to start our hook while its value expects a mandatory output file (short \u201cof:\u201d) that points to a path where we want the new seccomp filter to be written. In fact, the output file is a json file which is often referred to as a seccomp profile that container engines such as Podman and Docker will eventually parse and compile into a seccomp filter for the kernel. When inspecting the generated profile we will notice that there are more syscalls than ls executes. Those syscalls are the ones that runc invokes after having applied the seccomp profile and before starting the container, so they are essential to prevent us from getting permission errors when reusing the profile. However, we do not need to worry about that as the hook is clever enough to add these syscalls. Let\u2019s run a few containers using the generated profile.\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo podman run --security-opt seccomp=/tmp/ls.json fedora:30 ls / > /dev/null\\n$ sudo podman run --security-opt seccomp=/tmp/ls.json fedora:30 ls -l / > /dev/null\\nls: cannot access \'/\': Operation not permitted\\n```\\n\\nMaybe you are as surprised as we were when first running this very example. It seems that ls uses additional syscalls with the -l flag which instructs ls to use a more verbose listing format. This example shows a limitation of our approach since the quality and completeness of the generated seccomp profile depends on the exhaustiveness when tracing, and that\u2019s clearly something to keep in mind when using the hook. To avoid rerunning everything from scratch, the hook allows for the specification of an additional input file. This input file serves as a baseline to which all traced syscalls are added. This way, we do not need to redundantly run all, potentially time-costly, previous workloads but can add new data on top. Let\u2019s try this out and rerun ls -l.\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo podman run --annotation io.containers.trace-syscall=\u201dif:/tmp/ls.json;of:/tmp/lsl.json\u201d fedora:30 ls -l / > /dev/null\\n```\\n\\nAs mentioned above, we need root privileges for running the eBPF hook. But now, as we have generated the new seccomp profile, we can use it for running the same workload in a rootless container.\\n\\n```\\n$ id -u\\n1000\\n$ podman run --security-opt seccomp=/tmp/lsl.json fedora:30 ls -l / > /dev/null\\n```\\n\\n# When can I lock down my container?\\n\\nOne of the issues with attempting to generate seccomp profiles this way is that we cannot always be sure of having crossed all code paths that the container can potentially run. But if we have fairly extensive tests we should be able to gather a substantial amount of the syscalls for running the container within our CI/CD system. Now when we put our container into production, we can continue tracing the syscalls in the new environment. For example, if you use Kubernetes you could send the annotation down to [CRI-O](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o) and it would run the hook. Now, we can periodically check if the generated profile has changed over time. If we do not see new syscalls added for a given amount of time, we can feel confident to start using the profile. If a container using the profile gets blocked from using a syscall, the kernel will continue to report these in the audit.log which allows us to manually look for missing syscalls.\\n\\n# Try it out!\\n\\nIt was essential for us to base our work on open standards, which is why we decided to use the hooks specified in the OCI runtime specification. This way, our approach works with OCI compliant container runtimes such as runc or crun. Furthermore, we did not want to tie the tracing feature to a specific container engine. We wanted different tools such as Podman, Docker, CRI-O or containerd to be able to use the hook to encourage collaboration across different communities. Hence, we chose to use an OCI runtime annotation (i.e., io.containers.trace-syscall) to trigger the hook which is a generally supported feature.\\n\\nAs a next step, feel free to generate your own seccomp profiles with the oci-seccomp-bpf-hook. We would love to have feedback and always welcome contributions."},{"id":"/2019/10/15/new","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2019/10/15/new","source":"@site/blog/2019-10-15-new.md","title":"Generate SECCOMP Profiles for Containers Using Podman and eBPF","description":"Valentin Rothberg checks in with the \\"Generate SECCOMP Profiles for Containers Using Podman and eBPF\\" blog here.

In my case 4 containers\\nare started as each of the two involved systems has 2 CPUs:\\n\\n```shell\\n$ mpirun --hostfile hostfile \\\\\\n   --mca orte_tmpdir_base /tmp/podman-mpirun \\\\\\n   podman run --env-host \\\\\\n     -v /tmp/podman-mpirun:/tmp/podman-mpirun \\\\\\n     --userns=keep-id \\\\\\n     --net=host --pid=host --ipc=host \\\\\\n     quay.io/adrianreber/mpi-test:30 /home/ring\\nRank 2 has cleared MPI_Init\\nRank 2 has completed ring\\nRank 2 has completed MPI_Barrier\\nRank 3 has cleared MPI_Init\\nRank 3 has completed ring\\nRank 3 has completed MPI_Barrier\\nRank 1 has cleared MPI_Init\\nRank 1 has completed ring\\nRank 1 has completed MPI_Barrier\\nRank 0 has cleared MPI_Init\\nRank 0 has completed ring\\nRank 0 has completed MPI_Barrier\\n```\\n\\nNow mpirun starts up 4 Podman containers and each container is running one\\ninstance of `ring`. All 4 processes are communicating over MPI with each other.\\n\\nThe following mpirun options are used:\\n\\n- `--hostfile hostfile`\\n\\n  The `hostfile` tells Open MPI on which systems to run how many processes.\\n  In the case of this example it contained:\\n\\n  `host1 slots=2`  \\n   `host2 slots=2`\\n\\n  This means to run two processes on `host1` and two processes on `host2`.\\n\\n- `--mca orte_tmpdir_base /tmp/podman-mpirun`\\n\\n  This tells Open MPI to create all its temporary files in `/tmp/podman-mpirun`\\n  and not in `/tmp`. If this is not specified Open MPI will create its temporary\\n  files in a directory with a host name in it in `/tmp` and if using more than one\\n  node this directory will be named differently on other nodes. This requires\\n  mounting the complete `/tmp` directory into the container which is a bit more\\n  complicated due to not being able to change SELinux labels of `/tmp`.\\n\\nThis is it for all the necessary parameters for `mpirun`, now the command is\\nspecified that `mpirun` should start; `podman` in this case.\\n\\n- `run`\\n\\n  This just tells Podman to run a container.\\n\\n- `--env-host`\\n\\n  This copies all environment variables from the host into the container. This\\n  is necessary to make Open MPI work at all. When `mpirun` is started it creates a\\n  daemon with which all other processes in this MPI job are communicating, it\\n  also tells all the MPI processes how to communicate with each other. All this\\n  is passed from `mpirun` to the actual MPI processes using environment variables.\\n\\n  Options passed from the user to `mpirun` are also communicated through\\n  environment variables. Now that the MPI process in the container has all the\\n  environment variables it can communicate with the main process (_Head Node\\n  Process_ (**HNP**)) and all the other involved processes.\\n\\n- `-v /tmp/podman-mpirun:/tmp/podman-mpirun`\\n\\n  This tells Podman to mount the directory where Open MPI creates its temporary\\n  directories and files to be available in the container. Through the environment\\n  variables from above the MPI process knows where to look for this directory.\\n\\n- `--userns=keep-id`\\n\\n  The user ID in the container should be mapped to the same ID on the outside of\\n  the container. This is necessary as all processes are communicating with each\\n  other over shared memory and this fails if the processes have different user\\n  IDs.

(then more CI)\\n\\n## By Chris Evich [GitHub](https://github.com/cevich)\\n\\nI wanted to write a detailed post about the CI setup we use for exercising proposed\\nchanges to [libpod (podman repo)](https://github.com/containers/podman). \xa0Unfortunately\\nthis topic (and automation in general)\\nis so big, most readers would end up on the floor, sound asleep, in a puddle of their\\nown drool. \xa0Instead, I will keep your fidget-spinner twirling, by jumping around\\nseveral topics.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nStarting with an overview on why we chose to use [Cirrus CI](https://cirrus-ci.org/), I\'ll\\nprovide a short 3-step\\nwalk-through of how it works, along with lots of links. \xa0Then, we\'ll go into more detail\\nregarding VM Image orchestration, before connecting that back to our Cirrus-CI\\nconfiguration.\\n\\n### Why Cirrus-CI\\n\\nI once said \\"testing code is at least 10x harder than writing it\\". This is especially true when a\\nsoftware-engineer believes their code is \\"perfectly good\\" (meaning, tons of bugs). At the same\\ntime, test automation is generally as reliable, as the inverse of its simplicity (especially when\\nit\'s never simple). Which brings me back to around July/August of \'18:\\n\\nThe libpod project was considered by many to be \\"perfectly good\\", but its automation was definitely\\nnot simple. At least one part or another constantly [jacked-up](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jacked_up#English).\\nAt the time, automation was split\\nacross two totally different services, operating with incompatible yet duplicate configurations.\\nThe third service is a downstream consumer of libpod, but at the time was also under consideration\\nto take over pull-request automation from the first two:\\n\\n- Travis\\n\\n  - With [Ubuntu Trusty only a few years old](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2014-April/000182.html),\\n    we ran tests on a platform version nobody was using,\\n    with bleeding edge-code jammed on top. \xa0Some OS-X tests ran, and we think at least one person\\n    looked at the results, some of the time, every once in a while.\\n  - Required a contrived containerized-environment to workaround host-side limitations. \xa0Fixes for\\n    fake environments almost never improve reality. e.g. impossible to test or fix AppArmor or\\n    SELinux problems from inside a container.\\n  - The tests did not represent reality. \xa0Most people would never run container tools within a\\n    container, and certain security tools like SELinux and AppArmor would not be tested running\\n    inside this environment.\\n\\n- PAPR\\n\\n  - An internal \\"maintenance mode\\" service, meaning only bug-fixes, no new features. Supported by a\\n    single, talented engineer, from another group, perfectly happy to be working on something else.\\n  - Fortunately it does have great support for running things on Atomic Host, which we still use to\\n    maintain our insanity...I mean, double-check some things.\\n  - The underlying infrastructure is unpredictably reliable. Mainly due to frequent\\n    [dog-food poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).\\n\\n- OpenShift\\n  - An elegant, impressive piece of machinery, with tests so numerous that most other projects would\\n    have trouble calling up enough drool.\\n  - Fantastic at testing containers and at-scale orchestration. \xa0However way too complex for our\\n    low-level, host-side poking of runtimes, and userspace.\\n  - Downstream from libpod by weeks or months depending on the platform, like RHEL for example.\\n  - Both Travis and PAPR already demonstrated the pain of testing host-side libraries/tools\\n    within a container, no further lessons or reruns required.\\n\\nAs if this vegetarian sausage wasn\'t already dripping with liquid goodness. \xa0The smallest little\\nnetwork blip, and you have to re-run the entire suite again. \xa0The importance of network speed and\\nrobustness can never be overstated. So I set out on a mission against complexity, toward being\\nable to reliably and frequently ruin engineer\'s \\"perfectly good\\" code before it merges.\\n\\n### GET OFF MY LAWWWWWN!\\n\\nThe Cirrus CI killer feature. \xa0You can selfishly\\n[bring\xa0your own cloud](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/supported-computing-services/)\\nand everything else to make\\nit work, and not have to share with Billy Bob\'s Used tire and doughnut shop. \xa0You\'re the master of\\nthe entire host and runtime environment, OS, kernel, packages, updates, everything! \xa0Then, with\\n[the Cirrus CI app](https://github.com/marketplace/cirrus-ci)\\non your code repository, testing follows this simple automated sequence:\\n\\n1. Create VMs (or containers) in your cloud, using your encrypted credentials.\\n2. Follow [instructions you\'ve spelled out like B-A-S-H](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/writing-tasks/#script-instruction).\\n3. Show green on exit(0) - the \\"pretty\\" engineer\'s code is properly spoiled (i.e. functional).\\n\\nSo\\n[Cirrus CI gives all the power](https://cirrus-ci.org/#comparison-with-popular-ciaas)\\nfor success, and/or blasting giant, perfectly round, holes in your own two feet!\\nOur CI experience can be as simple or complex as we like, and reliability will match that of major\\ncloud providers and the inverse of our cleverness. What could possibly go wrong? :D\\n\\n### VM Image Orchestration\\n\\nImplementing the bowels of any CI/Automation stack usually begins with orchestrate the initial\\noperating system state. \xa0Therefore, for efficiency-sake, it\'s handy to cache this work before,\\nexercising project-code changes. Otherwise, it\'s a complete waste of (expensive) engineer-time\\nto constantly install, update, and configure all aspects of the system during every test run.\\n\\nAs\\n[recommended by Cirrus CI](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/supported-computing-services/#custom-vm-images)\\n, we utilize a tool by the inventors of Vagrant: [Packer](https://www.packer.io/). \xa0I was able to\\nmake it do things in a matter of minutes, as packer is fairly brain-dead-simple. \xa0It accepts a JSON\\nfile, which I have simplified as YAML for readability. A simple (non-functional) example will\\ndemonstrate the basic ideas:\\n{% raw %}\\n\\n````yaml\\n---\\n\\nvariables: \xa0# all up-front, no guessing allowed!\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0foo: \\"bar\\" # simple\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0build_image_suffix: \\"-libpod-{{env `COMMIT_SHA`}}\\"# from env. var\\n\\nbuilders: \xa0# Where to do stuff\\n\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0- type: \\"googlecompute\\" \xa0\xa0# TONS of others supported too\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0image_name: \'{{build_name}}{{user `build_image_suffix`}}\'\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0# ... more details ...\\n\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0- type \\"googlecompute\\"\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0# ...other OSes...\\n\\nprovisioners: \xa0# How to do stuff\\n\\n    - type: \\"shell\\"\\n      script: \\"/path/to/{{build_name}}_setup.sh\\" \xa0# macro looks up OS\\n\\npost-processors: \xa0# Where to stick stuff\\n    - - type: \'googlecompute-export\'\\n        paths: ... # name of storage bucket where VM Image will rest.\\n```{% endraw %}\\n\\nIn English, the above translates to:\\n\\n1. Using some provided variables like `foo`, but fill the variable `build_image_suffix`\\n   using the env. vars `$COMMIT_SHA`\\n2. Spin up some VMs in GCE.\\n3. Upload and execute a shell script on each VM (in parallel).\\n4. Assuming success, store the resulting VM image into a storage bucket for\\n   later use as needed, or will expire and get automatically deleted after a time.\\n\\nPerhaps that\'s over-simplifying things a little, but\\npacker provides mostly [just the bear-necessities](https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/index.html)\\n(sorry, [song is stuck in my head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08NlhjpVFsU)). Roughly ten\\nminutes after running a simple packer build command, the VMs are automatically torn down, and their disks\\nsaved. \xa0At a time of our choosing, an image can be imported from the storage bucket,\\nthen a small PR tossed up to activate the images for Cirrus.\\n\\n### Packer &rarr; Cirrus-CI Connection\\n\\nNext up the stack, we\'ll dig into some basic details of the Cirrus CI system. \xa0If you\'ve used\\nservices like Travis before, this example .cirrus.yml file won\'t be too surprising (simplified\\nsomewhat for example purposes):\\n\\n```yaml\\n---\\n\\n# Safely stored details about accessing our cloud\\ngcp_credentials: ENCRYPTED[blahblah]\\n\\nenv: \xa0# environment and behavioral values for all tasks and scripts\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0# Where to clone the source code into\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0CIRRUS_WORKING_DIR: \\"/var/tmp/go/src/github.com/containers/libpod\\"\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0SCRIPT_BASE: ./contrib/cirrus \xa0# saves some typing (below)\\n\\ntesting_task: \xa0# One particular set of things to do\\n\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0gce_instance: \xa0# What kind of VM to use\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0image_name: \xa0# Same as image_name produced by packer (above)\\n\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0script: \xa0# Step by step\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0- $SCRIPT_BASE/setup_environment.sh \xa0\xa0# does what it says\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0- $SCRIPT_BASE/unit_test.sh \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0# this too\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0- $SCRIPT_BASE/integration_test.sh \xa0\xa0\xa0# and this\\n````\\n\\nWith [Cirrus CI \\"installed\\"](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/quick-start/)\\non a GitHub repository, upon any pull\\nrequest change, Cirrus CI will step\\nin to kick things within GCE, then report back results in your pull request.\\n\\nHowever, we also need to test more than one OS. \xa0This is easily accomplished in Cirrus CI, by\\nusing what they call a\\n[matrix modification](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/writing-tasks/#matrix-modification).\\nRoughly translated into simple country-folk speak as: \\"_we done messed up our YAML parser\\nto do more fancier things, and stuff_\\". Illustrated in part by looking at an\\nexcerpt from our\\n[actual .cirrus.yml file](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/.cirrus.yml)\\nin the libpod repository:\\n\\n```yaml\\n...cut...\\n\\ntesting_task:\\n\\n \xa0\xa0gce_instance:\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0image_project: \\"libpod-123456\\"\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0zone: \\"us-central1-a\\"\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0cpu: 2\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0memory: \\"4Gb\\"\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0disk: 200\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0matrix:\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0image_name: \\"ubuntu-18-libpod-a250386d\\" # <-- name from packer\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0image_name: \\"fedora-28-libpod-a250386d\\"\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0image_name: \\"fedora-29-libpod-a250386d\\"\\n...cut...\\n```\\n\\nThe above will automatically duplicate the `testing_task` three times, running a different VM image\\nfor each. You can run a matrix across other items as well, like environment variables. There are\\nalso options for filtering your matrix, and adding dependencies between tasks. I\'d spell those\\nour for you, but it\'s liable to suck the lubrication from your fidget-spinner.\\n\\n### Good looks and clean presentation\\n\\nAnother Cirrus CI feature we utilize, has to do with the way\\n[the scripting](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/writing-tasks/#script-instruction) output is\\npresented. This\\nincludes what you don\'t see, like extraneous buttons and widgets. The way details are presented\\ncan be critical for debugging. Here\'s how we leverage that simplicity:\\n\\n```yaml\\ntesting_task:\\n\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0...cut...\\n\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0setup_environment_script: $SCRIPT_BASE/setup_environment.sh\\n\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0unit_test_script: $SCRIPT_BASE/unit_test.sh\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0integration_test_script: $SCRIPT_BASE/integration_test.sh\\n\\n \xa0\xa0\xa0...cut...\\n```\\n\\nIt\'s possible to have multiple scripts or commands per \\\\_script section. \xa0Because we dedicate one\\nper, the output is presented in bite-size pieces:\\n\\nThis makes it super easy to find what you\'re looking for. If the unit-tests fail with a complaint about\\nsome invalid environment variable. It\'s easier to drop down that box than to go scrolling through\\na giant\\n[wall of text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wall_of_text)\\n(though that\'s sometimes necessary also). On the other hand, if the output\\nwas all jammed into a single \\\\_script block, tracking down problems might get too challenging\\nfor my old-fogy sensibilities. Mind I\'ve only celebrated my 38th birthday four times so far...and\\nremember exactly zero of what happened those nights.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThere are many other details I could get into, but sadly, my coffee mug is empty and I can see that I\\nforgot to wash it (again). \xa0Nevertheless, if you need some simple nuts-and-bolts automation, I\\nhighly recommend [Cirrus-CI](https://cirrus-ci.org). It\'s (beer) free to use for open-source\\nprojects. The\\n[Google Cloud Engine](https://cloud.google.com)\\nis also pseudo-free for quite a while, since they give you a\\nvery generous, and substantial startup credit.\\n\\nOther than finding a new mug or my soap, if there are any burning questions here,\\nor snide remarks there, please feel free to find me in #podman on Freenode (IRC).\\nUnless the question is too-smart, I might even be able to answer it. Until then,\\nmay your pretty code keep its bugs well hidden _and_ out of sight."},{"id":"/2019/03/16/podman-install","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2019/03/16/podman-install","source":"@site/blog/2019-03-16-podman-install.md","title":"podman-install","description":"x---","date":"2019-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 16, 2019","tags":[],"readingTime":0.36,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"prevItem":{"title":"CI, and CI, and CI, oh my! &lpar;then more CI&rpar;","permalink":"/blogs/2019/03/18/CI3"},"nextItem":{"title":"Podman and Buildah for Docker Users!","permalink":"/blogs/2019/02/21/pandb-4-users"}},"content":"x---\\ntitle: Installation of Podman to Run Docker Container - Part 1  \\nlayout: default\\nauthor: tsweeney\\ncategories: [blogs]\\ntags: [containers, images, docker, buildah, podman, oci]\\n\\n---\\n\\n![podman logo](../static/vectors/raw/podman.svg)\\n\\n# Installation of Podman to Run Docker Container - Part 1\\n\\n## By Tom Sweeney [GitHub](https://github.com/TomSweeneyRedhat)\\n\\nA new article about how Opvizor installed [Podman to run Docker containers](https://www.opvizor.com/installation-of-podman-to-run-docker-container-part-1?sp_url=6k5w).

Furthermore, all of this is accomplished without a daemon!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nPodman made its first public release, v0.2, a little less than a year ago. We\'ve come a long way since then, adding new features like:\\n\\n- Rootless containers\\n- Support for pods\\n- Interacting with Kubernetes pod YAML\\n- A Varlink API for interacting with Podman on remote machines\\n\\nWe\'ve kept our eyes firmly on stability, fixing over 150 bugs. We\u2019ve also worked on performance, making sure all common operations are optimized. While it is an iterative process, we are pleased with where we stand today. With that, we\'re excited to announce that Podman is ready for prime time, and it is ready for you.\\n\\nA key focus of Podman is around security. In addition to support for rootless containers, we\u2019ve added many other security features. Great support for [User Namespaces](https://opensource.com/article/18/12/podman-and-user-namespaces) has resulted in better container separation. The `podman top` command will tell you what security features are enabled for processes within containers. Podman\u2019s daemonless fork/exec model preserves audit information on containers.\\n\\nThis is just the beginning, and we have plans for much more. For example, numerous improvements are planned for rootless Podman, pod support, the Varlink API, and automatic user namespace separation. If you find a feature missing from Podman, feel free to open an enhancement request on our [Github](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues). We love your feedback, and many of our best ideas come from users and contributors.\\n\\nFinally, the Podman team would like to thank all our contributors. Everyone who submitted code, improved documentation, or reported bugs has been a great help.\\n\\n## Changes\\n\\nA few of the biggest changes from Podman 1.0.0 include:\\n\\n- Added the `podman play kube` command, which creates Podman pods based on Kubernetes pod YAML.\\n- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support the `--init` flag, to run a minimal init process in the container.\\n- Added the `podman image sign` command to sign container images.\\n- Image pulls are now parallelized for increased speed\\n\\nAs always, please visit our release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md) to see the full changelog.\\n\\nYou can find instructions for installing Podman [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/install.md)"},{"id":"/2019/01/16/podman-varlink","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2019/01/16/podman-varlink","source":"@site/blog/2019-01-16-podman-varlink.md","title":"Programmatic remote access to Podman via the varlink protocol","description":"podman logo","date":"2019-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 16, 2019","tags":[{"label":"podman","permalink":"/blogs/tags/podman"},{"label":"varlink","permalink":"/blogs/tags/varlink"},{"label":"rust","permalink":"/blogs/tags/rust"},{"label":"python","permalink":"/blogs/tags/python"},{"label":"go","permalink":"/blogs/tags/go"},{"label":"golang","permalink":"/blogs/tags/golang"}],"readingTime":7.015,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"haraldh"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Programmatic remote access to Podman via the varlink protocol","layout":"default","author":"haraldh","categories":["blogs"],"tags":["podman","varlink","rust","python","go","golang"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Podman v1.0.0 Released","permalink":"/blogs/2019/01/16/podman-release-v1.0.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Managing pods and containers in a local container runtime","permalink":"/blogs/2019/01/15/podman-pods"}},"content":"![podman logo](../static/vectors/raw/podman.svg)\\n\\n# Programmatic remote access to Podman via the varlink protocol\\n\\n## By Harald Hoyer [GitHub](https://github.com/haraldh)\\n\\nThis guide shows how to access Podman remotely via the [varlink interface](https://varlink.org)\\nwith CLI tools and programmatically with python, go and rust.\\n\\nThis should work on Linux, MacOS and Windows 10.\\n\\nThe [compatibility matrix](https://varlink.org/Language-Bindings) shows which feature is supported on which OS in which language.\\n\\n> Note: replace `<podman-machine>` in this guide with the IP or hostname of your\\n> Podman machine\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\n### Windows ssh\\n\\nIf you are on a windows client machine, install the OpenSSH Client built by Microsoft in a cmd.exe in\\nadmin mode:\\n\\n```cmd\\n> dism /online /Add-Capability /CapabilityName:OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0\\n```\\n\\nClose cmd.exe window.\\n\\n> Note: Works also with other ssh clients, e.g. ssh from [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).\\n\\n### Generate ssh keys\\n\\nIf you don\'t want to type your password all the time, or not use an ssh agent, set an empty password.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/podmanuser\\n```\\n\\n## Set up Podman on the Fedora/RHEL machine\\n\\n```bash\\n$ sudo yum install podman libvarlink-util\\n$ sudo groupadd podman\\n```\\n\\nCopy `/lib/tmpfiles.d/podman.conf` to `/etc/tmpfiles.d/podman.conf`.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ sudo cp /lib/tmpfiles.d/podman.conf /etc/tmpfiles.d/podman.conf\\n```\\n\\nEdit `/etc/tmpfiles.d/podman.conf`:\\n\\n```\\nd /run/podman 0750 root podman\\n```\\n\\nCopy `/lib/systemd/system/io.podman.socket` to `/etc/systemd/system/io.podman.socket`.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ sudo cp /lib/systemd/system/io.podman.socket /etc/systemd/system/io.podman.socket\\n```\\n\\nEdit section `[Socket]` of `/etc/systemd/system/io.podman.socket`:\\n\\n```\\n[Socket]\\nListenStream=/run/podman/io.podman\\nSocketMode=0660\\nSocketGroup=podman\\n```\\n\\nThen activate the changes:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload\\n$ sudo systemd-tmpfiles --create\\n$ sudo systemctl enable --now io.podman.socket\\n```\\n\\nThe directory and socket now belongs to the podman group\\n\\n```bash\\n$ sudo ls -al /run/podman\\ndrwxr-x---.  2 root podman   60 14. Jan 14:50 .\\ndrwxr-xr-x. 51 root root   1420 14. Jan 14:36 ..\\nsrw-rw----.  1 root podman    0 14. Jan 14:50 io.podman\\n```\\n\\n> Note: Wouldn\'t it be nice, if there was a Podman group owning the socket already? ;-)\\n\\nNow we are adding a user `podmanuser` and set a password:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ sudo useradd podmanuser -G podman\\n$ sudo passwd podmanuser\\n```\\n\\nFrom your client machine do\\n\\n```bash\\n$ ssh-copy-id -f ~/.ssh/podmanuser podmanuser@<podman-machine>\\n```\\n\\n### ssh config\\n\\nEdit `.ssh/config`\\n\\n```\\nHost <podman-machine>\\n    RequestTTY no\\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/podmanuser\\n    User podmanuser\\n    VisualHostKey no\\n    RemoteCommand /usr/bin/varlink bridge --connect unix:/run/podman/io.podman\\n    GSSAPIAuthentication no\\n    ForwardX11 no\\n```\\n\\n### Optional Lock Down\\n\\nLog into `<podman-machine>`\\n\\n```bash\\n$ ssh podmanuser@<podman-machine>\\n```\\n\\nNow we lock down `podmanuser` to only be used with the varlink bridge from your client machine:\\n\\nEdit `.ssh/authorized-keys` so that the line begins with:\\n\\n```\\ncommand=\\"/usr/bin/varlink bridge --connect unix:/run/podman/io.podman\\",no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-pty,no-user-rc,no-X11-forwarding ssh-rsa [\u2026]\\n```\\n\\nLog out of `<podman-machine>`\\n\\n## Python\\n\\n### Install Python\\n\\nhttps://www.python.org/downloads/\\n\\n### Install varlink for Python\\n\\n```bash\\n$ pip install --user \\"varlink>=30.0.2\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Test if the varlink cli module works\\n\\n```bash\\n$ python -m varlink.cli --help\\nusage: cli.py [-h] [-r RESOLVER] [-A ACTIVATE] [-b BRIDGE]\\n

Starting with Podman v3.3, the `podman machine` command now does that same function and is part of the Podman project. Please see Brent Baude\'s [update](https://podman.io/blogs/2021/09/06/podman-on-macs.html) or the [podman machine](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/machine.html) man page on [docs.podman.io](https://docs.podman.io/) for more information on how to run Podman machine.

It is on purpose of course. When creating\\ncontainers, we want the ability to specify various security or network attributes. But if you are in the unenviable position to have to keystroke in some of these lengthy commands, it can grow tiresome. Defining labels on the container image is a great way to define how the container should be run; however, now with Podman we can read and execute that label saving you potential command line bloat.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### Container image Labels\\n\\nContainer images have had the concept of a label for quite some time. They are often used as identifiers for the image; i.e. version, release, author, etc. But you can create a container label for just about anything. With the Atomic CLI project, we used to leverage labels such as RUN, INSTALL, and UNINSTALL. These labels we defined for the purpose of their verbiage.\\n\\n### Podman container runlabel\\n\\nTo mimic the Atomic CLI project, we added a sub-command called `podman container runlabel`. This command will execute the contents of a given label as defined by the container image.\\n\\nLets consider an example. I have a simple container image based on mariab that I use for my Podman development. The image is made like so:\\n\\n```\\nFROM docker.io/library/mariadb:latest\\nLABEL RUN=\\"podman run --name some-mariadb -P -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=x -dt IMAGE\\"\\nRUN echo \\"bind-address = 0.0.0.0\\" >> /etc/mysql/my.cnf\\n```\\n\\nNote the definition of the RUN label in the image. It contains the complete command line description of how to run it. The use of IMAGE here is a placeholder is automatically substituted by Podman to the real image name. On my system, this image exists as `quay.io/baude/demodb:latest`.\\n\\nWe can get a preview of what Podman would run using the `--display` switch. In the case of my mariab image, a dry-run would show something like this:\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo podman container runlabel --display run quay.io/baude/demodb:latest\\nCommand: /proc/self/exe run --name some-mariadb -P -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=x -dt quay.io/baude/demodb:latest\\n```\\n\\nNote how the IMAGE was translated into the image name. If we rerun the previous command and subtract the `--display` option, podman will create the container exactly as described by the run label.\\n\\nSo, next time you create your own image, do yourself a favor and construct labels that Podman can read and simplify your life."},{"id":"/2018/11/27/podman-exists","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2018/11/27/podman-exists","source":"@site/blog/2018-11-27-podman-exists.md","title":"Podman container|image exists","description":"podman logo","date":"2018-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 27, 2018","tags":[{"label":"podman","permalink":"/blogs/tags/podman"},{"label":"containers","permalink":"/blogs/tags/containers"}],"readingTime":2.165,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"baude"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman container|image exists","layout":"default","author":"baude","categories":["blogs"],"tags":["podman","containers"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Simplifying Podman commands with labels","permalink":"/blogs/2018/12/03/podman-runlabel"},"nextItem":{"title":"Build Podman RPMs with a container image","permalink":"/blogs/2018/11/19/build_libpod-container-images"}},"content":"![podman logo](../static/vectors/raw/podman.svg)\\n\\n# Podman container|image exists\\n\\n## By Brent Baude [GitHub](https://github.com/baude)\\n\\nWe are seeing a proliferation of Podman usage in users\' daily workflows. As such, these workflows are often scripted -- in something like bash -- and clear exit codes from the applications being run are paramount. One of the tasks we often see is a user wanting to verify if an image or a container exists in local storage. We saw several different approaches approaches to solving this including running `podman ps` or `podman images` with filters or complex uses of grep.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### Solution\\n\\nAfter a bit of discussion with our users, recorded in [issue #1845] (https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/1845), a plan was hatched to have a specific command that satisfies this use case. It was implemented for both containers and images; and I suppose if users wish, we could implement it for pods as well. If the image or container exists, Podman will return an exit code of `0`. If it does not exist, Podman will return an exit code of `1`. Any other exit code can be attributed to non-verification failures like permissions or failure in reading local storage.\\n\\n### Check on an images\\n\\nTo verify the existence of an image in your local storage, you can use the command `podman image exists <IMAGE_NAME>`. Let\'s clarify through the use of an example.\\n\\nThe images we have in our local storage are as follows:\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo podman images\\nREPOSITORY                   TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE\\ndocker.io/library/alpine     latest   196d12cf6ab1   2 months ago   4.67 MB\\n```\\n\\nIf we wanted to verify the existence of the image `docker.io/library/alpine:latest`, we would:\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo podman image exists docker.io/library/alpine:latest\\n$ echo $?\\n0\\n```\\n\\nYou can also verify by short-name if preferable:\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo podman image exists alpine\\n$ echo $?\\n0\\n```\\n\\nYou can also verify an image by an image\'s full or shortened ID.\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo podman image exists 196d12cf6ab1\\n$ echo $?\\n0\\n```\\n\\nAnd finally, a failure to verify example would look like:\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo podman image exists busybox\\n$ echo $?\\n1\\n```\\n\\n### Check on a container\\n\\nWe can verify the existence of a container in much the same way as an image. The grammar differs slightly.\\n\\nMy system has the following container:\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo podman ps --format {% raw %}\\"{{.ID}} {{.Names}}\\"{% endraw %}\\n472fde2f48c7 foobar\\n```\\n\\nAnd I can verify the existence of the container with `podman container exists <CONTAINER_NAME>`.\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo podman container exists foobar\\n$ echo $?\\n0\\n```\\n\\nLike images, you can also verify a container using its full or partial container ID."},{"id":"/2018/11/19/build_libpod-container-images","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2018/11/19/build_libpod-container-images","source":"@site/blog/2018-11-19-build_libpod-container-images.md","title":"Build Podman RPMs with a container image","description":"podman logo","date":"2018-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 19, 2018","tags":[{"label":"podman","permalink":"/blogs/tags/podman"},{"label":"containers","permalink":"/blogs/tags/containers"}],"readingTime":2.395,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"baude"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Build Podman RPMs with a container image","layout":"default","author":"baude","categories":["blogs"],"tags":["podman","containers"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Podman container|image exists","permalink":"/blogs/2018/11/27/podman-exists"},"nextItem":{"title":"The State of Container Technologies in the Operating System","permalink":"/blogs/2018/11/01/talk-state_of_container_technologies"}},"content":"![podman logo](../static/vectors/raw/podman.svg)\\n\\n# Build Podman RPMs with a container image\\n\\n## By Brent Baude [GitHub](https://github.com/baude)\\n\\nLibpod development is still very much active and on-going. We often have folks who are looking\\nto test out the latest libpod and Podman for either new features or bug fixes. We typically\\nbuild RPMs for distributions like Fedora on a release cadence, which used to be weekly but now\\nhas slowed down as libpod has stabilized. Building libpod from source is not difficult, but\\nsometimes the user\'s environment will not allow them to install all the packages needed; or\\nperhaps the user is intimidated by building from source; or perhaps the user would prefer\\nthe RPM package because it will make the upgrade process easier down the road.\\n\\nTo solve this problem, I have created a series of container images for CentOS7, Fedora 28, and Fedora 29 that are capable of building a development Podman RPM and associated packages.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n#### A bit about the images themselves\\n\\nThe image that can used to build the RPMs is called _quay.io/libpod/build_libpod_. You simply\\nalter the tag to build for the various distributions. The _latest_ tag will build CentOS7\\nRPMs. Two other tags exist: _fedora28_ and _fedora29_.\\n\\n### Create the temporary directory\\n\\nCreate a directory for where the RPMs will be volume mounted. It **must** be _/tmp/rpms_.\\n\\n```\\n$ mkdir /tmp/rpms\\n```\\n\\n### Build the RPMs\\n\\nBuilding the RPMs is a simple Podman command that leverages the `container runlabel` function in Podman. Once the image is pulled by Podman, it will install the required packages for building the RPMs. After the build is complete, the container will also test to make sure the RPMs install correctly.\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo podman container runlabel -p run quay.io/libpod/build_libpod:fedora29\\nTrying to pull quay.io/libpod/build_libpod:fedora29...Getting image source signatures\\nSkipping

Podman Relationship\\n\\n## By Tom Sweeney [GitHub](https://github.com/TomSweeneyRedhat)\\n\\nKubernetes installations can be complex with multiple runtime dependencies and runtime engines. [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/) was created to provide a lightweight runtime for Kubernetes which adds an abstraction layer between the cluster and the runtime that allows for various OCI runtime technologies. However you still have the problem of daemon dependencies in your cluster for builds - I.e. if you are using the cluster for builds you still need a Docker daemon.\\n\\nEnter Buildah. Buildah allows you to have a Kubernetes cluster without any Docker daemon for both runtime and builds. Excellent. But what if things go wrong? What if you want to do troubleshooting or debugging of containers in your cluster? Buildah isn\u2019t really built for that, what you need is a client tool for working with containers and the one that comes to mind is Docker CLI - but then you\u2019re back to using the daemon.\\n\\nThis is where Podman steps in. Podman allows you to do all of the Docker commands without the daemon dependency. With Podman you can run, build (it calls Buildah under the covers for this), modify and troubleshoot containers in your Kubernetes cluster. With the two projects together, you have a well rounded solution for your OCI container image and container needs.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nBuildah and Podman are two complementary Open-source projects that are available on\\nmost Linux platforms and both projects reside at [GitHub.com](https://github.com)\\nwith Buildah [here](https://github.com/containers/buildah) and Podman [here](https://github.com/containers/podman). Both Buildah and Podman are command line tools that work on OCI images and containers. The two projects are related, but differ in their specialization.\\n\\nBuildah specializes in building OCI images. Buildah\'s commands replicate all\\nof the commands that are found in a Dockerfile. Buildah\u2019s goal is also to provide a lower level coreutils interface to build container images, allowing people to build containers without requiring a Dockerfile. Buildah\u2019s other goal is to allow you to use other scripting languages to build container images without requiring a daemon.\\n\\nPodman specializes in all of the commands and functions that help you to maintain and modify those OCI container images, such as pulling and tagging. It also allows you to create, run, and maintain those containers. If you can do a command in the Docker CLI, you can do the same command in the Podman CLI. In fact you can just alias \u2018podman\u2019 for \u2018docker\u2019 on your machine and you can then build, create and maintain container images and containers without a daemon being present, just as you always have.\\n\\nAlthough Podman uses Buildah\u2019s build functionality under the covers to create a container image, the two projects have differences. The major difference between Podman and Buildah is their concept of a container. Podman allows users to create `traditional containers` and the intent of these containers is to be controlled through the entirety of a container life cycle (pause, checkpoint/restore, etc). While Buildah containers are really created just to allow content to be added to the container _image_. Each project has a separate internal representation of a container that is not shared. Because of this you cannot see Podman containers from within Buildah or vice versa. However the internal representation of a container image is the same between Buildah and Podman. Given this, any container image that has been created, pulled or modified by one can be seen and used by the other.\\n\\nSome of the commands between the two projects overlap significantly but in some cases have slightly different behaviors. The following table illustrates the commands with some overlap between the projects.\\n\\n| Command           | Podman Behavior                                                                                                                                                      | Buildah Behavior                                                                                                                                                      |\\n| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| build             | Calls `buildah bud`                                                                                                                                                  | Provides the build-using-dockerfile (bud) command that emulates Docker\u2019s build command.                                                                               |\\n| commit            | Commits a Podman container into a container image.

Using\\ncheckpoint/restore it is now possible to resume a container after a reboot at\\nexactly the same point in time it was checkpointed.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nIn January 2018 I started to think about bringing checkpoint/restore support to\\nPodman. After a few initial discussions I started to actually look at the\\nnecessary code changes. As Podman uses\\n[runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) to run containers the initial\\nsupport for checkpointing containers was implemented pretty fast. Restoring was\\na bit more complicated as it required additional changes to\\n[conmon](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-o/pull/1427).\\n\\nAt that point I was able to checkpoint and restore a simple container.\\n\\nTo make checkpointing and restoring containers actually useful the restored\\ncontainer needs to have the same IP address as the checkpointed container. That\\nwas the point where the implementation got a bit complicated.\\n\\nAlthough having worked on and with different container runtime\'s\\ncheckpoint/restore support I never had a closer look at the networking setup.\\nIt always worked. With Podman it did not at the beginning. The biggest\\ndifference is, as far as I understand it right now, is that Podman uses\\n[Container Network Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni)\\nto configure the container\'s network. CNI creates a network namespace and after\\nconfiguring it tells `runc` to use that network namespace for the container.\\n\\nThe difference with this setup is that other container runtimes did not really\\ncare about the actual name of the network namespace and CRIU just created on\\nrestore a **new** network namespace with the same properties as during checkpoint.\\nSo a new network namespace was created. For Podman this needs to be different.\\nCRIU needs to ignore/skip the network namespace and to handle this correctly I\\nhad to adapt runc\\n([Add support to checkpoint and restore into external network namespaces](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/1849))\\nas well as CRIU\\n([criu: add support for external net namespaces ](https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu/commit/a8a3eb902305f0af603afa4c95b1b632fe7bd149)).\\n\\nSo after spending time on `runc` and CRIU I was able to return to Podman and\\nimplement the [necessary changes](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/469)\\nwhich have been merged into Podman at the beginning of October 2018.\\n\\nWith all the background information out of the way, now finally some examples\\nhow checkpoint/restore can be used in Podman. In my example I am using a\\ncontainer running [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) with a slightly\\nmodified HelloWorldExample. The HelloWorldExample has been modified to return\\na single integer which is is incremented after each request.\\n\\nThe following starts my test container:\\n\\n```shell\\n# podman run --security-opt=\\"seccomp=unconfined\\" --tmpfs /tmp --name podman-criu-test -d docker://docker.io/yovfiatbeb/podman-criu-test\\n```\\n\\nAs I am running my tests on a RHEL7 system I have to add\\n`--security-opt=\\"seccomp=unconfined\\"` because CRIU cannot correctly handle\\n`seccomp` on RHEL7. The option `--tmpfs /tmp` is necessary as `tomcat` creates\\ntemporary files in `/tmp` which are only correctly restored by CRIU if `/tmp`\\nis a `tmpfs`.\\n\\nOnce the container is up and running I can use `curl` to make requests to `tomcat`:\\n\\n```shell\\n$ curl 10.22.0.53:8080/examples/servlets/servlet/HelloWorldExample\\n1\\n$ curl 10.22.0.53:8080/examples/servlets/servlet/HelloWorldExample\\n2\\n```\\n\\nI can now checkpoint the container:\\n\\n```shell\\n# podman container checkpoint podman-criu-test\\n```\\n\\nNow the container is no longer running and could be restored. If I would\\nrestore the container now the result would basically be the same as pausing and\\nunpausing the container. To make checkpointing useful I am now rebooting the\\nsystem before restoring the container. Once the system is up again I can\\nrestore the container:\\n\\n```shell\\n# podman container restore --keep podman-criu-test\\n```\\n\\nUsing `curl` to make requests to the container the result will now **not** start at\\n\'1\' again, but continue at the previous value:\\n\\n```shell\\n$ curl 10.22.0.53:8080/examples/servlets/servlet/HelloWorldExample\\n3\\n$ curl 10.22.0.53:8080/examples/servlets/servlet/HelloWorldExample\\n4\\n$ curl 10.22.0.53:8080/examples/servlets/servlet/HelloWorldExample\\n5\\n```\\n\\nAs I have been using the `--keep` flag during restore, Podman has not deleted\\nthe checkpoint after the restore, which would be the normal operation. If I\\nreboot the system again I can restore the container again:\\n\\n```shell\\n$ podman container restore --keep podman-criu-test\\n```\\n\\nAnd now the result from `curl` is the same as before:\\n\\n```shell\\n$ curl 10.22.0.53:8080/examples/servlets/servlet/HelloWorldExample\\n3\\n$ curl 10.22.0.53:8080/examples/servlets/servlet/HelloWorldExample\\n4\\n$ curl 10.22.0.53:8080/examples/servlets/servlet/HelloWorldExample\\n5\\n```\\n\\nSo right now checkpointing and restoring can be used as either a stateful\\npause/unpause between reboots or as way to go back in time of the container\'s\\nlife.\\n\\nI recorded all those steps in the demo below:\\n\\n<a href=\\"https://asciinema.org/a/FsTbx9mZkzeuhCM2pFOr1tujM\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><img src=\\"https://asciinema.org/a/FsTbx9mZkzeuhCM2pFOr1tujM.png\\" width=\\"650\\"/></a>\\n\\nThe checkpoint/restore support in Podman is still very new and requires a git\\ncheckout of CRIU using the `criu-dev` branch to work right now. The necessary\\nCRIU changes will be in the upcoming CRIU 3.11 release. `runc` and `conmon`\\nalso need to be new enough for checkpoint/restore to work.\\n\\nCurrently only checkpoint/restore on the same system is supported, but to\\nmake this feature really interesting it would be nice to be able to\\nmigrate containers. To make container migration easy I want to offer\\nthe possibility to easily export the checkpoint and appropriate container\\nstate from one Podman instance to another Podman instance to be able to\\nrestore the checkpointed container."},{"id":"/2018/10/07/tripleo-upgrade","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2018/10/07/tripleo-upgrade","source":"@site/blog/2018-10-07-tripleo-upgrade.md","title":"OpenStack Containerization

Of course, users cannot use this directory when running as non root, so Podman creates the storage by default in $HOME/.local/share/containers.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWhen Podman creates this storage it is running inside of a user namespace and is allowed to create UIDs and GIDs based off the UID ranges stored in /etc/subuid and the GIDs listed in /etc/subgid.\\n\\nFor example my account has UID and GID ranges 100000 through 165535 reserved for it, as well as my UID and primary GID, 3267.\\n\\n```\\n#grep dwalsh /etc/subuid\\ndwalsh:100000:65536\\n$ grep dwalsh /etc/subgid\\ndwalsh:100000:65536\\n```\\n\\nWhen Podman starts a container as non root, by default, it maps my UID, 3267, to UID 0 inside of the container, then it maps 100,000->1, 100,001->2, 100,002->3 \u2026 165,535->65536.\\n\\nYou can see this mapping inside of the container\\n\\n```\\n$ podman run -ti fedora cat  /proc/self/uid_map\\n\\t 0       3267          1\\n\\t 1     100000     65536\\n$ podman run -ti fedora cat  /proc/self/gid_map\\n\\t 0       3267          1\\n\\t 1     100000     65536\\n```\\n\\nSince I\u2019m root in the container, I can create and set ownership of files inside of the container for using any UIDs and GIDs that are mapped into the container.\\n\\nTo see what happens, I will create a file and directory owned by a non root user inside of a container.\\n\\n```\\npodman run -ti --name testfile fedora bash -c \\"mkdir /testdir; touch /testdir/testfile; chown -R 1:1 /testdir\\"\\n```\\n\\nSince that was successful, let\u2019s mount the container and see what it looks like from outside of the user namespace that\u2019s used for running the container.\\n\\n```\\n$ mnt=$(podman mount testfile)\\n$ echo $mnt\\n/home/dwalsh/.local/share/containers/storage/vfs/dir/691e874b6e1ba6807ecbe73910396b10f118617233aacc3df3297ffc4e1332f9\\n$ ls -l $mnt\\ntotal 4\\nlrwxrwxrwx.  1 dwalsh dwalsh    7 Feb  7  2018 bin -> usr/bin\\ndr-xr-xr-x.  2 dwalsh dwalsh    6 Feb  7  2018 boot\\ndrwxr-xr-x.  2 dwalsh dwalsh    6 Apr 26 09:03 dev\\ndrwxr-xr-x. 44 dwalsh dwalsh 4096 Apr 26 09:03 etc\\ndrwxr-xr-x.  2 dwalsh dwalsh    6 Feb  7  2018 home\\nlrwxrwxrwx.  1 dwalsh dwalsh    7 Feb  7  2018 lib -> usr/lib\\nlrwxrwxrwx.  1 dwalsh dwalsh    9 Feb  7  2018 lib64 -> usr/lib64\\ndrwx------.  2 dwalsh dwalsh    6 Apr 26 09:03 lost+found\\ndrwxr-xr-x.  2 dwalsh dwalsh    6 Feb  7  2018 media\\ndrwxr-xr-x.  2 dwalsh dwalsh    6 Feb  7  2018 mnt\\ndrwxr-xr-x.  2 dwalsh dwalsh    6 Feb  7  2018 opt\\ndrwxr-xr-x.  2 dwalsh dwalsh    6 Apr 26 09:03 proc\\ndr-xr-x---.  2 dwalsh dwalsh  162 Apr 26 09:03 root\\ndrwxr-xr-x. 11 dwalsh dwalsh  169 Sep 25 09:11 run\\nlrwxrwxrwx.  1 dwalsh dwalsh    8 Feb  7  2018 sbin -> usr/sbin\\ndrwxr-xr-x.  2 dwalsh dwalsh    6 Feb  7  2018 srv\\ndrwxr-xr-x.  2 dwalsh dwalsh    6 Apr 26 09:03 sys\\ndrwxr-xr-x.  2 100000 100000   22 Sep 25 13:38 testdir\\ndrwxrwxrwt.  2 dwalsh dwalsh   32 Apr 26 09:03 tmp\\ndrwxr-xr-x. 12 dwalsh dwalsh  144 Apr 26 09:03 usr\\ndrwxr-xr-x. 19 dwalsh dwalsh  249 Apr 26 09:03 var\\n```\\n\\nNotice the ownership of testdir and testfile. The namespace that was used for running the container mapped UID 100000 from outside of the namespace to UID 1 inside of the namespace, and did the same for GID 100000, mapping it to GID 1 inside of the namespace. When I set the ownership to UID and GID 1 from inside of the namespace, the corresponding values from outside of the namespace were what were recorded to disk.\\n\\n```\\n$ ls -la $mnt/testdir\\ntotal 0\\ndrwxr-xr-x.  2 100000 100000  22 Sep 25 13:38 .\\ndrwxr-xr-x. 19 dwalsh dwalsh 257 Sep 25 13:38 ..\\n-rw-r--r--.  1 100000 100000   0 Sep 25 13:38 testfile\\n```\\n\\nIf i just try to clean up my directory I will get lots of errors.\\n\\n```\\nrm -rf .local/share/containers/ 2>&1 | head -2\\nrm: cannot remove \'.local/share/containers/storage/vfs/dir/891e1e4ef82ad02a4ea1f030831f942d722c7694c4db64ca3239c8163b811c58/bin\': Permission denied\\nrm: cannot remove \'.local/share/containers/storage/vfs/dir/891e1e4ef82ad02a4ea1f030831f942d722c7694c4db64ca3239c8163b811c58/boot\': Permission denied\\n```\\n\\nThis is because this content was created from inside of a user namespace where I was UID 0, and because I was UID 0 in that namespace, I could set and change ownership of anything owned by any ID that was mapped into the namespace. In this case, I assigned it an owner that wasn\u2019t mapped to my own user. Once I left the namespace, and I was back in the host namespace where I was just myself again, the contents belonged to the UID that I had mapped to 1 for the user namespace, which wasn\u2019t my own UID.\\n\\nBecause of this, if I wanted to clean it all up, I could become root to remove the directory. But if I don\u2019t have root on the machine, what could I do?\\n\\n### `Buildah unshare` or `rootlesskit  bash`\\n\\nWell currently [Buildah](https://buildah.io) or [rootlesskit](https://github.com/rootless-containers/rootlesskit) can put you into the user namespace without launching a container and then you can remove the images.\\n\\n```\\n$ buildah unshare\\n[root@localhost ~]# id\\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023\\n```\\n\\nI am now root inside of a namespace with the same mappings I\u2019d use for a container, but everything else is the same.

Using the python interface means you can run these commands from a MAC or Windows Box, as long as you have a Linux box with podman installed. We connect using _varlink_ for the messaging protocol between client and service.\\n\\nFor the environment, you will need:\\n\\n    * Linux host\\n    * podman package\\n    * enable the io.podman.socket systemd unit file by executing\\n\\nsystemctl enable --now io.podman.socket\\n\\n    * Python3\\n    * The python3-podman rpm, or podman package from PyPi.\\n\\n_Note: Currently, there is a matching rpm for each version of podman.

Each container is presented\\n    #   as a Namespace and dict. You determine which is easiest for you to use\\n    #   for your solution.\\n    for c in client.containers.list():\\n\\n\\t # A bit of sugar, convert any podman-formatted timestamp to\\n        #   a python datetime\\n        created_at = podman.datetime_parse(c.createdat)\\n\\n        if created_at > midnight:\\n\\n            # Now the results. We provide datetime_format() for consistent\\n\\t     #   iso format in results if you wish to use it.\\n            print(\'ID: {}\\\\n image: {}\\\\n createdAt: {}\'.format(\\nc.id[:12], c.image[:33], podman.datetime_format(created_at)))\\n```\\n\\nOnce you have this code copied into the file:\\n\\n    * chmod 755 latest_containers.py\\n    * podman run fedora sleep 300 &\\n    * ./latest_containers.py\\n\\n```console\\nID: d7337530c6d1\\n image: registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora\\n createdAt: 2018\u201308\u201310T09:18:09.728858\u201307:00\\n```\\n\\nYou can watch the whole process [here](https://asciinema.org/a/mu8Knm5dj8mII19evrF9heNCF).\\n\\nThe container object above supports the Namespace and dict protocols. This is our most used data structure providing you the ability to use the returned object in your code as you wish.\\n\\nConnecting to a remote host, requires only changing how you create the Client() in any script:\\n\\n```console\\nWith podman.Client(uri=\'unix:/run/user/17945/podman/io.podman\',\\nremote_uri=\'ssh://ruser@podman.example.com:22/run/podman/io.podman\') as client:\\n```\\n\\n    * uri provides the local side of the ssh tunnel\\n    * user is your username\\n    * remote_uri provides the details needed to connect to the remote host, plus the socket file for podman. A complete ssh uri is supported to allow configuration of ports etc.\\n    * ruser is the remote host username to be used for authentication\\n    * podman.example.com is the FQDN of the host you are running the podman service on\\n    * The port number of 22 is given above for completeness, that is the default and may be omitted.\\n    * An identity file may be provided via identity_file, otherwise the podman library will defer to ssh for authenticating.\\n\\nAll other function and method calls are the same whether they are remote or local. Note: all filesystem paths are resolved on the host running the podman service not the podman client.\\n\\n## But wait there is more!\\n\\nTo iterate over all the images stored on the system, you only need to change containers to images like:\\n\\n```console\\nfor i in client.images.list():\\n```\\n\\nTo find podman system information, you need to use: `client.system.info()`. Or, `client.system.versions()` if you need to know the release of the podman service components.\\n\\nTo determine if the podman service is available and working, `client.system.ping()` will return `True` if everything is working correctly.\\n\\nOne of the most complex operations is creating a new container from an image, the workflow:\\n\\n    * Pull image from registry\\n    * Instantiate image object\\n    * Set container options\\n    * Create OCI container and object\\n\\n```console\\nwith podman.Client() as client:\\n ident = client.images.pull(name)\\n img = client.images.get(ident)\\nopts = {\\n \'memory\': \'1G\',\\n \'memory-reservation\': \'750M\',\\n \'Memory-swap\': \'1.5G\',\\n }\\nctnr = img.container(**opts)\\n```\\n\\nOur calling pattern is \u201cclient.&ltmodel&gt.&ltmethod&gt(&ltoptions&gt)\u201d, where the current models are:\\n\\n    * Images\\n    * Containers\\n    * System\\n\\nThe Podman man pages provide details on the methods and options to be used for each.\\n\\nWhat\u2019s been shown in this blog is how easy it is to use the Python module to do Podman commands from your Linux host. These bindings can be used on the same host that Podman is running on, or they could be used on a remote host. Although there is not a complete one to one correspondence between the Podman commands and the ones available via the Python bindings\u200a\u2014\u200ayet, the end goal for this project is to get to that point. For instance the commands for interacting with pods are currently under development and when available, the Python module will be updated to allow access. In addition to that, there\u2019s work underway to make this Python module available on MacOS and Windows via PyPi. When these ports go live, you will be able to interact with Podman service from any Linux, MacOS or Windows host.\\n\\nI hope you have found the information in this blog to be useful and gives you further insight into Podman and this Python module.

You will see hand fulls of significant features below that have been added to podman this week. All of it is awesome work from the core team and its contributors. There were also two interesting features that users will be interested in: the ability to create a container with multiple networks and the podman remote client.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWe have heard from users that they wish to be able to create containers with multiple networks. This can now be done with a combination of CNI configurations and podman. The easiest approach is to take the default podman configuration file `/etc/cni/net.d/87-podman-bridge.conflist` and duplicate it. Within the file, change the:\\n\\n    * network name\\n    * bridge device (cni0 -> cni1)\\n    * subnet\\n\\nThen run podman like:\\n\\n```\\n$ podman run -it --network=podman,podman2 fedora:28 /bin/bash\\n```\\n\\nJhon Honce and I have also been working on a remote client for podman, called pypodman. It is written in Python and allows users to have a podman-like front-end that accesses an actual podman backend on another node. It relies heavily on ssh and we recommend the use of ssh keys to simplify things.\\n\\nOur vision is this could eventually become useful for those using Macs or Windows as a development environment. Look for more official blogs and write-ups specifically on this.\\n\\nThis is also the release where we start introducing pod concepts. We now have minimal support for pods. Try `podman pod\u200a\u2014\u200ahelp` for further information.\\n\\n# Other significant features include but are not limited to:\\n\\n    * More unit tests for the varlink python client\\n    * Correction behavior for podman stats\\n    * Add\u200a\u2014\u200avolumes-from to podman run and create\\n    * Fix a small regression in our opt handling\\n    * Add a default AppArmor profile\\n    * Fix path for rootless containers\\n    * Varlink API fixes in how we start start and attach to containers\\n    * Podman ps now reports containers as \u2018dead\u2019 instead of \u2018unknown\u2019\\n    * Correct behavior in podman rmi on how to handle parent image deletions\\n    * Logged output now goes to syslog as well as STDERR\\n    * When pulling an image by SHA1, we now set the name and tag correctly.\\n    * Better recording of exit codes for container exits"},{"id":"/2018/07/09/podman-alpha-v0.7.1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2018/07/09/podman-alpha-v0.7.1","source":"@site/blog/2018-07-09-podman-alpha-v0.7.1.md","title":"Podman Alpha version 0.7.1 Release Announcement","description":"podman logo","date":"2018-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 9, 2018","tags":[{"label":"community","permalink":"/blogs/tags/community"},{"label":"open source","permalink":"/blogs/tags/open-source"},{"label":"podman","permalink":"/blogs/tags/podman"}],"readingTime":1.26,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"bbaude"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman Alpha version 0.7.1 Release Announcement","layout":"default","author":"bbaude","categories":["releases"],"tags":["community","open source","podman"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Podman Alpha version 0.7.2 Release Announcement","permalink":"/blogs/2018/07/16/podman-alpha-v0.7.2"},"nextItem":{"title":"Podman Alpha version 0.6.4 Release Announcement","permalink":"/blogs/2018/07/02/podman-alpha-v0.6.4"}},"content":"![podman logo](../static/vectors/raw/podman.svg)\\n\\n# Podman release 0.7.1\\n\\nLast week was a busy holiday week here in the United States, but we still managed a nice release full of interesting merges.\\n\\nMany of the significant merges are going to be less than noticeable to users. A lot of updated vendor code was added as well as the removal of unused functions due to cgroups and platform changes.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nSpeaking of platform changes, one thing I have been working on the last few weeks is to cross-compile for Darwin from Linux. This was really our first need to deal with other platforms and was rather invasive at times. It took several merges over the last few weeks to complete but we have are able to _build_ a Darwin binary. I must emphasize _build_ because the binary is known to not run\u200a\u2014\u200aas there is a lengthy list of things that would need to be fixed or implemented first. Nevertheless, my goal here was to implement a CI test that would always perform the build so we can protect against subsequent regressions for Darwin should someone decide to work on that platform.\\n\\n## Other significant changes include:\\n\\n    * several changes to the makefile to make it more efficient\\n    * fix parsing of short options by vendoring in a new urfave/cli\\n    * tutorial fixes\\n    * revert back to a shared cgroup for conmon processes\\n    * remove buildah requirement for the libpod image library\\n    * block use of /proc/acpi from inside containers\\n    * factor pkg/ctime into a separate package"},{"id":"/2018/07/02/podman-alpha-v0.6.4","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2018/07/02/podman-alpha-v0.6.4","source":"@site/blog/2018-07-02-podman-alpha-v0.6.4.md","title":"Podman Alpha version 0.6.4 Release Announcement","description":"podman logo","date":"2018-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 2, 2018","tags":[{"label":"community","permalink":"/blogs/tags/community"},{"label":"open source","permalink":"/blogs/tags/open-source"},{"label":"podman","permalink":"/blogs/tags/podman"}],"readingTime":2.265,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"bbaude"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman Alpha version 0.6.4 Release Announcement","layout":"default","author":"bbaude","categories":["releases"],"tags":["community","open source","podman"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Podman Alpha version 0.7.1 Release Announcement","permalink":"/blogs/2018/07/09/podman-alpha-v0.7.1"},"nextItem":{"title":"Podman Alpha version 0.6.1 Release Announcement","permalink":"/blogs/2018/06/04/podman-alpha-v0.6.1"}},"content":"![podman logo](../static/vectors/raw/podman.svg)\\n\\n# Podman release 0.6.4\\n\\nThis afternoon we were able to overcome some last minute bugs and release a new Podman. The packages are building in Fedora and will work their way through Fedora\u2019s bodhi system. For giggles, I looked at the number of individual contributors this week and was glad to see the number at 10.\\n\\nMainly bugfixes this week, one big one was that we do a better job cleaning up containers that run in the back ground.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n**podman container cleanup** was added to cleanup mountpoint, cgroups and network configuration when containers exit. When a container is run in background mode (-d), the podman command exits, but **conmon** continues to run and monitor the container, when the container exits, conmon executes podman container cleanup to cleanup the container.\\n\\nThere were a number of bug fixes and a lot of vendoring new code\u200a\u2014\u200aGolang speak for updating the code we depend on from other projects. Interesting things are in store for podman in the upcoming weeks. Stay tuned!\\n\\nI missed writing this blog the last couple of weeks, and wanted to point out a huge new feature from the **buildah project**. **podman build** now supports layering. As you may know podman build by default only adds one layer when processing a Dockerfile. This is different the **docker build**. Docker defaults to layering each line in the Dockerfile, which makes the creation of an application easier, since docker build jumps to the first line changed in the Dockerfile since the previous build. Podman build on the other hand starts at the beginning, which works better in using a Dockerfile in a build system. With the introducion of the\u200a\u2014\u200alayers flag, you can now get the same behaviour in podman build that you have in docker build, incremental changes to the Dockerfile will start the build at the change point rather then in the beginning. There is even a environment variable BUILDAH_LAYERS which can be set to default to the layers method.\\n\\n## Notable features include:\\n\\n    * Continued work on podman remote client. A mock up of a podman remote client went into the contrib/ section of our repository. This is not ready for anyone but Jhon Honce as the primary contributor to the python library code.\\n    * Continued work on running podman without requiring you to be root. Giuseppe Scrivano made a bunch of commits related to rootless containers.\\n    * added podman-image and podman-container man page links\\n    * fixed a fatal error where when a container disappeared during podman ps.\\n    * added an authfile option to podman search to deal with private registries.\\n    * fixed a bug related to container startup and attached mode.\\n    * building podman with varlink support is now optionional."},{"id":"/2018/06/04/podman-alpha-v0.6.1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/2018/06/04/podman-alpha-v0.6.1","source":"@site/blog/2018-06-04-podman-alpha-v0.6.1.md","title":"Podman Alpha version 0.6.1 Release Announcement","description":"podman logo","date":"2018-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 4, 2018","tags":[{"label":"community","permalink":"/blogs/tags/community"},{"label":"open source","permalink":"/blogs/tags/open-source"},{"label":"podman","permalink":"/blogs/tags/podman"}],"readingTime":1.115,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"bbaude"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman Alpha version 0.6.1 Release Announcement","layout":"default","author":"bbaude","categories":["releases"],"tags":["community","open source","podman"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Podman Alpha version 0.6.4 Release Announcement","permalink":"/blogs/2018/07/02/podman-alpha-v0.6.4"}},"content":"![podman logo](../static/vectors/raw/podman.svg)\\n\\n# Podman release 0.6.1\\n\\nIt seems that when we have a short work week here in the US, we have rather large releases.
